 Did you have to be an accredited investor to sell or just to buy?
 Just to buy.
 But employees could sell on these sites, and the vast majority of all volume of being traded on these sites was Facebook shares in .
 And this was starting to be a really big problem because now all of a sudden Facebook and other companies whose shares were trading on these sites, it sort of lost control of these shares, and they had all these shareholders out there who didnt know who they were.
 And at the time, pre JOBS Act, the laws were that you had to have less than shareholders as a private company.
 Once you had more than shareholders, you had to go public.
 And so this was happening in Facebook more than any other company at the time.
 In an effort to sort of try and also get under this shareholder rule, in January Facebook separately did a rather infamous deal with Goldman Sachs that didnt go so well.
 The first part of the deal went fine, and that was that Goldman invested million itself in Facebook.
 That happened.
 But the second part of the deal, and that was at a billion valuation, the second part of the deal was that Goldman was going to create a special purpose vehicle that was going to be one single entity, and then it was going to market to its private wealth management clients the ability to invest in this special purpose vehicle that was going to be a .
 billion in total, and then that vehicle would invest in Facebook.
 And so they sent this email out to select private wealth management clients of Goldman saying, you know, opportunity of a lifetime.
 It was like a Nigerian cash scam email that Goldman was sending out to their clients.
 They couldnt even say the company by name.
 It was an unnamed high growth private company that they were offering the opportunity, once in a lifetime opportunity to invest in.
 Wow.
 But you throw the Goldman brand behind that, and it seems like, yeah, sure.
 Seemed like a good idea at the time and to Facebook too.
 Well, the SEC didnt think of it as such a good idea.
 So the New York Times DealBook actually leakedscooped that this was happening, and after that, the SEC started investigating and Goldman ended up they still ended up doing the deal but they did it will all foreign clients, so they decided that it was too risky to have US investors invest in the deal.
 This was a huge, huge moment.
 Big egg on Goldmans face and on Facebooks face for what came across as really trying to skirt US securities laws.
 Up until that point, Goldman had been sort of top billing the running to be the bank that would take Facebook public.
 Right.
 And this basically killed their chances of being leadleft on the IPO.
 For those of us kind of not from the industry, what is leadleft?
 So when investment bankers take a speaking as a reformed investment banker myself when investment bankers take a company public, theres usually a consortium of banks that underwrite the IPO.
 But theres one bank thats the leader and thats referred to be as being leadleft which is on the cover of the prospectus of the IPO.
 The bank thats at the top and on the left, is leadleft.
 They get the biggest allocation of the IPO.
 And its always a huge battle amongst the big bulge bracket banks for hot IPOs and there was never going to be any IPO hotter than Facebook to be the lead left.
 Not only because theyd make a lot of money from it but the prestige associated with that.
 Well, in theory well see what really happened, live on for a long time.
 So because of these two things that were happening, there was immense pressure on Facebook to finally go public in the timeframe.
 So, late they start preparing.
 They actually select Morgan Stanley, Goldmans longtime rival, to be leadleft.
 Theyre deep preparing for the IPO, and business is going great.
 For the year of they ended the year with million monthly active users, million daily active users.
 So doing the math on that, thats over DAU to MAU ratio, which means over half of Facebooks users used it every single day, which is just incredible.
 Wild.
 And still to this day, there are so few products that are like that.
 And not just usage but engagement.
 So, they were seeing at the end of over .
 billion likes and comments per day, which is crazy.
 By the time they actually went public in they amended their S filing to include Q numbers, and in Q they saw .
 billion likes and comments every single day.
 Which those likes and comments numbers, they like to put that in there.
 Its like almost an unfathomable, ridiculous vanity metric, right?
 Because theres nothing to compare it to and really, its hard to wrap your head around what that even means.
 Well, but its engagement, right?
 People arent just opening the app.
 They are actually doing stuff in the app.
 Right.
 Great point.
 And in these days well get to this in a second it wasnt so much the app as it was the website on desktop.
 Not only, you know, things are going really well for Facebook at this point.
 Not only do they have these huge, unprecedented user base, unprecedented engagement, but they are making real money too.
 Yeah, they were profitable by their IPO.
 Very profitable.
 So, in they did .
 billion in revenue and over .
 billion in operating income, which is really incredible.
 You think of a private startup at that point in time.
 People had never seen a private company at kind of this scale of both revenue and profitability.
 Right.
 Lets see.
 Thats a .
 operating margin.
 Yeah.
 As we were talking about it before the show, hiring Sheryl Sandberg to build advertising at Facebook was one of, if not the best, decision that Mark Zuckerberg ever made.
 Yeah.
 This is worth a quick little story, but before March of Facebook didnt have Sheryl Sandberg kind of at the helm as COO.
 And they had no ad product.
 Yeah, theyre just running banner ads.
 They cut some deal with Microsoft.
 Mark was totally allergic to cannibalizing the purity of the site with advertising.
 In March of Sheryl Sandberg came in, and her goal and her charter was make the company profitable.
 So before she joined, the company was primarily interested in building a really cool site.
 Profits, they assumed, would follow.
 In late spring, Facebooks leadership team finally agreed that they were going to rely on advertising with the ads discretely presented and then it was kind of her charter over the next years to actually build an inhouse competency coming from Google of a real ad platform.
 Of a real advertising platform.
 And in years to go from, you know, essentially nothing.
 Like they were making plenty of revenue but it was low quality revenue from banner ads.
 To go from essentially nothing to almost billion in revenue and almost billion in profit?
 Wild.
 Totally wild.
 Interestingly, this is a fun side fact, this was the days of the Facebook platform and games on Facebook and particularly FarmVille.
 They noted in their Sfiling that Zynga alone represented of Facebook revenue at the time of the IPO.
 Thats a huge risk.
 Yeah!
 That was in the risk factors.
 So as were alluding to, things are going great.
 February the big day, the day that everybody in tech has been waiting for, Facebook files its S which happens Now it happens before you go public, you file your registration statement, the prospectus for going public.
 In those days it happened even longer before the actual IPO happens.
 Now its a fairly short time period after some of the changes made in the JOBS Act.
 So February they file.
 Morgan Stanley is leadleft banker.
 Then showing how far Goldman had fallen just a year earlier, they were in the poll position to be leadleft.
 They actually get demoted to third.
 So JP Morgan is second and Goldman is third.
 So this was a big, big demotion for Goldman.
 But as we shall see, Morgan being leadleft on the Facebook IPO, wasnt necessarily the golden egg that the banks thought it was.
 So things are great, but theres one problem with Facebook right now.
 Whats that?
 And that problem is mobile.
 Yeah.
 So fascinatingly enough, in their S, when theyre listing the summary risk factors to the business this ones incredible one of the risk factors is growth in use of Facebook through our mobile products, where we do not currently display ads as a substitute for use on personal computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results.
 So, the risk factor theyre identifying here is not that we dont know how were going to monetize the phone, we havent rolled out phone ads yet.
 The risk is that people start using mobile products more than desktop products, and we dont have a revenue model there.
 Yeah.
 They literally had no revenue model.
 So, two aspects to this very huge problem for Facebook right now, the mobile problem.
 One is a usage and engagement problem.
 And we just talked about this incredible usage and engagement metrics that they had, but thats all on desktop.
 On mobile, they have mobile apps for Facebook, but these are the dark ages of HTML, and the misery of the HTML mobile Facebook app which was so slow, basically impossible to use.
 And as a result, only about half to slightly less than half of Facebooks users were active on mobile.
 And like fascinating to think about all the implications to mobile being an afterthought.
 When you open the app, the newsfeed as we know it today, was not one unified newsfeed where you would see the same thing on the mobile app that you would on desktop.
 It was like you would see a completely different set of information, like a different algorithm determining what you would see, served down to you a different way, cached in a different way, obviously not nearly as responsive.
 Philosophically, they wanted to be able to move faster by dynamically controlling the HTML that was served down without having to resend it to the app store.
 Right.
 And not making a bet on, you know, this was as weve talked about on the show, the age of the mobile platform wars and is iOS going to win or Android, and they thought they could be really flexible by having this HTML app that was one app that would get put in a wrapper and shipped to both app stores.
 But yeah, it was not working.
 No.
 And its funny even doing the research for this episode.
 I read a bunch of articles about this and I remember doing this.
 A lot of people, rather than installing or using the app on their phone for Facebook, they would go to m.
facebook.
com and use the mobile web because it was better than the crappy app that they had.
 Yeah.
 Shocking.
 I mean, this was in tech years, plus years ago,  years ago, a long time, but its not like the mobile ecosystem was undeveloped at this point in time.
 There were apps like Uber existed.
 There was no excuse for not having I think Twitter had already bought Tweetie, so the iOS client for Twitter was exceptional at the time.
 Tweetie became the native app.
 To put this in perspective, where they had no ability to monetize on mobile at this point and they So onehalf of the huge gaping chest wound that Facebook had at this point was the app sucked.
 Then the other half was they had no monetization.
 They made no money from mobile.
 Right.
 To put that in perspective today, David will tell us the story of kind of everything along the way.
 Facebooks earnings came out a couple of weeks ago and mobile advertising revenue represented of ad revenue for the quarter.
 So that was the third quarter of as were recording this today.
 Yeah.
 And its basically the entire business today.
 So the story of how we got there is massively tied up in the Facebook IPO.
 And actually even just a couple months later after the IPO in September Zuckerberg was onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt that year and he said the biggest mistake weve made as a company is betting on HTML over native in mobile.
 Thats how much over a few short months he realized what a big problem he had.
 Wow.
 Its probably worth before diving back into the story to set some context on the numbers here.
 So, IPO, biggest in technology history, you know, third largest of all time.
 The market cap for Facebook was billion.
 Which well get into in a sec.
 Okay, cool.
 Yeah, why dont you just dive in then.
 Okay.
 So were still on the road to IPO and its now April.
 Facebook has been working on its roadshow and presenting to investors, large institutions who will buy into the IPO.
 And on April they come out with a rather shocking announcement at the time that weve already covered on this show in one of early episodes, and that is in fact our benchmark of what a great acquisition is.
 They announced that theyre acquiring Instagram.
 And we talked about this a little bit on the episode.
 But just to step back again here and put this into context of how crazy this was, that Facebook had filed their S.
 Theyre in the process of going public and they acquire a company that has employees for a billion dollars.
 This was just crazy.
 But, underscores how much, how Mark and Sheryl and the team were coming to realize how big of a problem mobile was for them.
 And the entire rationale for the Instagram acquisition was around bolstering their story and their user base in mobile.
 I remember trying to rationalize this at the time and talking to friends.
 I think we even talked about this on the Instagram episode that there were a few things that Facebook held near and dear, one of which was being the source of platform andidentity, and that was quickly becoming really important to them to get a foothold in, that everybody sort of needed a Facebook as infrastructure on the internet.
 But the killer app for Facebook was photos.
 It was photo sharing, yup.
 Its what got by far the most engagement, it was nostalgic.
 All those comments and likes, billions every day.
 Yeah.
 And so, for them, to lose that foothold where thats really their core strength, is this is where people share and engage and photos.
 Thats a total existential threat, especially when everyones attention shifting to mobile and they dont have a credible offering there.
 In this time leading up to the actual IPO, Facebook was, and most companies do amend their S, their registration statement quite frequently as new information comes up, and theyre working through feedback from investors and whatnot.
 Of course, they amend it for this acquisition that they announced.
 And its interesting, they say in the S that they intend to continue operating Instagram as a standalone entity and product, which we talked about on our show.
 But, interesting that they actually put that in the S for Facebooks IPO.
 But then they also say, this is after they talk about Instagram but in the same paragraph, We believe that mobile usage of Facebook is critical to maintaining user growth and engagement over the long term, and we are actively seeking to grow mobile usage, although such usage does not currently directly generate any meaningful revenue.
 This is how important theyre realizing its becoming.
 Also, interesting side note that I found while I was doing research here.
 There was a breakup fee on the Instagram acquisition of million.
 So if for whatever reason the acquisition didnt go through, Facebook would have paid Instagram million.
 Wow!
 Thats enormous.
 Because Instagram, like a lot of that time, youre going to have a breakup fee like that because of the incredible cost that you incur by, you know opportunity cost, negotiation, and like the time.
 Usually, you see those things often when its like a public company acquiring another public company, its impacting the stock price But this was a person startup.
 Right.
 And its not like when we were talking to Zillows CEO, Kathleen Philipps, how like the negative signal that it could send to the market to Trulias shareholders and to Trulias incredible number of stakeholders from the advertisers to all the people that depended on them.
 Like, Instagram didnt have a lot of stakeholders.
 Instagram didnt have a high opportunity cost through other things they could be doing at the tune of million.
 Its not like they even had more than a few people working on the acquisition.
 It was Kevin and Mike talking.
 And some very excited VCs on their board.
 Yeah!
 No kidding.
 Wild that its that high.
 So, things keep moving along in the process.
 On May Facebook files the sixth amendment to its S.
 Were going to come back to that in a minute.
 Things keep going along.
 And midMay, they decide that theyre going to set Friday, May as the day that Facebook goes public.
 So the start of that week, though, theres an inauspicious start and thats at the beginning of the week, GM General Motors that weve already talked about on this episode announces that theyre going to stop all advertising on Facebook because its not actually working that well for them.
 Theyve been spending million a year with Facebook.
 And they wanted flashier ad units.
 I mean, their major complaint was, look, on all these blogs they are letting us take over the whole back page, we can slide stuff in from the sides, we can get this big header that pushes all the content down, and all we get are these crummy, little static ads on Facebook on the side.
 And I dont know if they had started newsfeed ads at that point, but either way, the ad formats on Facebook have historically been so much more limiting than the kind of arguably userhostile things that you get across the advertising ecosystem on the web.
 Yup.
 But, you know, no matter.
 Ten million dollars?
 Thats a big account.
 But Facebook made .
 billion the past year.
 So a drop in the bucket, things proceed.
 The night before the IPO, Thursday night, Facebook holds an allnight hackathon leading up to the IPO and then in the morning, everybodys been up all night and the whole company rings the bell for the NASDAQ remotely from California, and Zuckerberg pushes the button.
 Big fanfare.
 Then, the company is supposed to start trading.
 So they price the IPO the night before they price at per share, which gives Facebook a market capitalization of billion at IPO.
 Again, unprecedented in technology history.
 They sell enough shares to consist of how much value?
 They sell million shares at a share, raising billion in the IPO and about half of that, the company keeps and about half of that is selling shareholders that are monetizing their shares.
 So, Zuckerberg presses the button.
 In the morning, everything is supposed to begin trading and actually, when companies go public on the NASDAQ, they actually delay trading a little bit so that at the open, the stock do start trading right away, they have a little time to make it orderly because usually theres a lot of interest in IPOs and a lot of trades are happening.
 Facebook was supposed to start trading at AM EST on Friday, May .
 comes, people are placing trades, no trades are happening.
 The NASDAQ is broken.
 Facebook has literally broken the NASDAQ.
 Everything is functioning for all other stocks.
 But what NASDAQ would later describe as a technical error occurs and this just unleashes mayhem on the Facebook stock.
 Traders are placing orders and they dont know if theyre going to get filled at all.
 Plenty of orders placed during this time period arent filled.
 Or if theyre going to get filled with the wrong price.
 Or if theyre going to get filled with the wrong price, so a lot of orders actually get filled at the wrong price, at a higher price than what people were placing them at.
 This is a disaster of epic proportions on NASDAQs part.
 And actually ends up contributing this really hurts NASDAQ.
I mean up until this point, NASDAQ had always been the place for technology companies, and all the tech companies were on the NASDAQ and the old school companies were on the New York Stock Exchange.
 After this, I mean NASDAQ still has plenty of tech IPOs but the New York Stock Exchange really makes a push.
 So when Twitter ends up going public, they do it on the New York stock exchange Fitbit, Grubhub, Zendesk.
 Lots of tech companies are now using the NYSE, and a lot of it is because of this.
 So its pretty bad and eventually, NASDAQ actually settles two lawsuits.
 The SEC files a suit against them.
 They pay million to the SEC and then a shareholder class action lawsuit against them because of this, for people who lost money in the Facebook IPO.
 And NASDAQ ends up paying .
 million to shareholders as a result.
 Ouch.
 So once it all gets sorted out though later in the day, Facebook does begin trading.
 And its pretty clear that things are not going well.
 The stock ends the day at .
, so up cents from offering price.
 But thats a really bad sign because that means they didnt get a pop from lots of excess demand and people wanting to buy the stock.
 And what that usually means and this is what happened in this case, that the underwriting banks ended up supporting the stock because theyve staked their reputation on this IPO, they dont want to let the price fall below the offering price, and so Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs end up buying a lot of shares to support the price on this first day of trading.
 Well, that doesnt sound sustainable.
 No, and it doesnt because the next trading day, which is the following Monday, its a blood bath.
 So, market opens on Monday and within minutes of trading starts, Facebook is down almost which doesnt sound like a lot, but stocks dont move in one day.
 Also, if you think about it, that means that like billion of market cap was destroyed.
 Just erased immediately.
 I mean, that would be like if the whole market moved that much, that would be like the Dow losing points in one day.
 And this is the second day, Facebooks second day as a public company.
 Thats like destroying Instagrams.
 Yeah!
 Immediately.
 So, not good.
 Its so not good that it actually trips whats called a circuit breaker that stock exchanges have built into them that if a stock starts really getting pummeled like this, theyll stop trading in it, so thats short selling Just for that stock?
 Just for that stock, yeah.
 So that short sellers cant aggressively bash the price down.
 So this is really bad, and ends up closing that day at about a share, which is down .
 The next day on, I guess, Wednesday, two days later, the stock opens, closes down another Or sorry, Tuesday, closes down another at a share.
 Wednesday, the stock opens and news hits that Facebook is getting slammed with a shareholder lawsuit because news has leaked that that sixth revision that Imentioned to the S prospectus a couple of weeks before the IPO, well, it turns out that there was actually a little more to that story than just revising the S and what happens is that, that was the first day of the official roadshow for Facebook on May .
 And Mark, Sheryl, and the executive team were doing the roadshow and at the end of the day, David Ebersman who was the CFO of Facebook at the time, takes Morgan Stanley aside and says to them, Hey, were actually going to lower our guidance for what we expect revenue and earnings to be for the second quarter.
 Wow.
 And you dont do this when youre on your IPO roadshow.
 Thats private information.
 Well, its private information but A you dont so they were giving guidance as part of the roadshow to institutional investors, sort of like, you could think of it like practicing your earnings calls but investors are going to want to know what managements outlook is for the future.
 Its practicing your earnings call but to one shareholder and not all the other people who are Well, right.
 Given the first part of a roadshow with the old estimates and so now they have to figure out what to do.
 But the other thing is you dont lower your guidance during the roadshow.
 You lower it before you go out on the roadshow.
 Once you started What would you do in this situation if youve gotten news that its going to come in lower if you were in the middle of your roadshow?
 How do you fix that?
 Well, you probably dont do what Facebook and Morgan Stanley did, which is that they decide that theyre going to call the equity researching analyst that are going to cover Facebook and theyre going to disclose this news.
 The reason for this, by the way, is that mobile was really hurting them.
 So they were terrified that they were going to come in below expectations because they were behind on mobile, and people were switching over to mobile faster than they could get products out the door and get monetization done.
 So they call up their research analyst, but they called the research analyst of the underwriting banks, and they tell them that theyre going to revise earnings down.
 And so, the underwriting banks Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, and Goldman they all call their clients, their institutional investors which are mutual funds and hedge funds, and they tell them Hey.
 Facebook, you know, this IPO thats going to be the IPO of the century next week, they actually just revised their forecast down.
 So youve now got this situation where the public has no idea that any of this is happening.
 But all the big institutions know.
 But all the big institutions know, all the clients of the banks that are doing the underwriting for the deal.
 And so, we find out much later but there was a huge amount of short selling pressure on the Facebook stock at the IPO because all these banks are, like, well now theres information asymmetry, like I know something you dont know.
 They should capitalize that on behalf of their clients.
 I mean, thats what they do.
 So is what they did a securities violation?
 Is that legal?
 Well, its very much a gray area.
 And, actually Facebook never gets in any trouble for this, but Morgan Stanley takes a big reputational hit and ends up settling a lawsuit actually with the Massachusetts state regulators.
 Im not sure it was Massachusetts and not the federal SEC.
 But the only lawsuit that ends up getting settled and its not that much money, Morgan Stanley pays million in the settlement to Massachusetts for this.
 But they tacitly admit wrongdoing here, and this is a big oopsy for them.
 Yeah.
 Its crazy thinking about it in these like highly controlled environments like this that a side conversation like the two of them had can create ripples of that magnitude.
 Well, when youre talking about a billion IPO that is literally the biggest in technology history, and youve just created this information asymmetry and thats going to be the most watched by all parties, including the SEC, of all time.
 Well, when you phrase it that way, David.
 Yeah.
 Not an auspicious beginning.
 So, all told, when all this is done, the first weeks of Facebook as a public company are terrible.
 The stock goes down during of the first trading days.
 And by the end of May, so weeks after the IPO, Facebook had lost a quarter of its value.
 And remember, an IPO at a billion market cap.
 So, billion in value just wiped out.
 Wow.
 The Wall Street Journal calls the IPO a fiasco.
 And so then, what do you do?
 So now youre the company, youre Mark, youre Sheryl, you go from being the most hyped IPO in history to literally a fiasco with all these shareholder lawsuits flying around.
 Yeah.
 Youve got this gaping chest wound of not figuring out mobile.
 Yeah.
 So to me, theres things going on here.
 One is the PR thing that you have to manage, and the entire financial ecosystem that youre now a part of and you really have to, weave carefully here on, you know, your next few quarters are going to be watched so carefully, youve taken a huge reputational hit, people are afraid of buying your stock, other people are opportunistic in getting in and feeling like its maybe a little risky.
 But then the other thing thats kind of going on here is, you know, Facebook just needs to inwardly look at their product and this is really what they do, is say, look, all of these symptoms that are happening in the financial market are because of the problem that, one, we dont have a credible, like a great mobile experience and two, everyone is shifting to mobile anyway, even with our crummy experience and we dont have an ability to monetize there.
 The interesting thing is it doesnt take them too much longer to actually launch, which Im sure youll tell us about in a moment, to launch their mobile ads product, but like, it is so interesting that as a management team, they kind of took a step back, focused on the fundamentals, focused on improving the product, focused on serving their customers, and actually rebounded from this with very strong step into mobile.
 For me, and well get into grading in a minute here, this is the defining moment for at least the public company part of Facebooks journey.
 This is why they are a great company and why Mark and Sheryl are great leaders.
 I mean, it would have been so easy to hit the panic button with everything going on here.
 The amount of pressure was just immense.
 But, they do exactly what you said.
 They spend the rest of the summer completely focused on mobile, and this is when you hear about Facebook has a very unique corporate culture, they have essentially like a propaganda department that makes posters and puts them up around campus in Menlo Park, and posters all of a sudden went up all over campus like mobile is our future and they get the whole company in the period of just one summer basically completely focused on mobile.
 They spend all summer working on native apps.
 August they release their native iOS app.
 The native Android app comes a little later.
 Then shortly thereafter, its not like they release that and the market is like, Oh, great.
 Problems are solved.
 On September Facebook hits its alltime low at .
 a share, which puts their market cap at about billion.
 So, they just lost billion of market cap.
 This is really the depth here.
 Wow.
 But they release a product, its a great product, people love the iOS app, and more importantly, it has the ability to insert ads into the feed.
 And now, the age of the native ad and advertising into Facebook feed on mobile is born and kind of like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, its just incredible.
 So, they dont turn on advertising in Q.
 But Q of they do turn on advertising on mobile and they go from literally to of the entire ad revenue for the whole company comes in via mobile in Q.
 Wow.
 Which is amazing because when you think about where they have transformed to today, they basically have cracked advertising on mobile.
 I mean, the newsfeed ad unit is like the best ad unit.
 I think that when we shifted to mobile, everybody tried to move their banners down to tiny little banners, and that didnt work very well.
 Yeah.
 I remember like Millennial Media and iAd.
 Oh, yeah.
 The AdMob and all that stuff.
 Oh my God.
 iAd launched my career.
 Did I ever tell you that story?
 Thats right!
 Yeah.
 In Seize the Day, we benefited from Apple.
 Which is an app that you build while youre in college, right?
 Yeah.
 Its kind of one of the early ToDo List in the store.
 We launched and were one of the first partners to have iAd in there.
 What a crappy ad format.
 We had ridiculous CPMs and Apple featured us.
 I think Nissan Leaf was one of three advertisers that actually bought Anyway, so banner ads didnt work very well.
 Apple since iAd, a lot of publishers are moving to just putting their square desktop ads in the middle of articles.
 People are getting closer with these sort of like native ads embedded into publisher formats.
 But what really works on mobile is Facebook ads.
 Is a native Facebook ad.
 When youre scrolling through that newsfeed, well, you scroll sort of or you stop at every story to pause and look at what it is, and for that brief moment, the advertiser has the opportunity to take over your entire captive attention in a way that they never could on desktop.
 And Facebook cracked it.
 The fact that of their revenue today and as a hugely successful company comes from mobile advertising, is a huge testament to them turning it around.
 They cracked it.
 I mean, in a period of about months, while going public, and while acquiring Instagram, they basically invented the mobile ad industry.
 I think a really nice way of putting a bow on and tying up the Facebook IPO story is that the next year, at TechCrunch Disrupt so in Zuckerberg said in an interview on stage that HTML was the biggest mistake that he had made in the history of the company.
 In TechCrunch Disrupt, Michael Arrington asks Zuckerberg onstage, you know, So how about that IPO?
 And Zuck says, this is a quote he says, Im the person you would want to ask last on how to do a smooth IPO.
 And this is a year later, he says, But its actually a valuable process having gone through a terrible first year, as it made our company a lot stronger.
 You have to know everything about your company.
 It took us to the next level, and we run our company much better now.
 Pretty interesting.
 Pretty interesting, yeah.
 Should we go into what would have happened otherwise?
 What would have happened otherwise?
 Well, I think is kind of a natural point of segue because in one of the things that I was thinking about in what would have happened otherwise is sort of three things that you get when you IPO.
 Three sort of like, advantageous components to it.
 The first is, an influx of cash.
 Obviously, Facebook is going to raise to billion in cash that goes directly to marketable securities or cash on hand for the company.
 The rest obviously goes to existing investors who are cashing out.
 The second is the fact that if theyre going to do MA transactions in the future, having public company stock way more valuable than difficult to value part of company stock.
 Not necessarily more valuable, but the industry term is its a liquid currency in that you can assign value.
 You can say like one share of Facebook stock is worth X on the public market.
 I can tell you with certainty it is worth .
 on September as opposed to, I dont know whats a share in PSL worth, Ben?
 Its a little speculative at this point.
 Yeah, exactly.
 And that ties into our third too is, liquidity for shareholders.
 So, when you IPO, youve got all these employees that have been working for private company stock options for years, a lot of them having purchased them.
 And, you know, they cant really get like where they can sort of use the SecondMarket.
 Oh, using SharesPost in SecondMarket.
 Yeah.
 So its interesting that some of the trials and tribulations of the IPO can be attributed to the fact that there was sort of a value assigned to the company by the transactions that were going on in SecondMarket.
 But there were so few of them that it was a pretty illiquid marketplace.
 So youve got this very rough estimate of what the company is worth sort of setting and guiding what theyre going to IPO for and if they hadnt IPOd, you could have even more of this going on, and the longer they wait, the more difficult it gets because people are super anxious to get liquid on part of their compensation that they held for years.
 A lot of it, lifechanging amounts of money.
 Yeah.
 I think its a year that a lot of the clear bungling of the IPO was probably a result of just waiting too long and there was so much pentup pressure there pressure to perform, pressure to the last round the Goldman had done, that they botched with letting private wealth management clients invest via the special purpose vehicle, that was at a billion valuation.
 So, Facebook wanted to deliver a X return on that and wanted to hit the mythical billion market cap.
 I think it was just a lot.
 Then they were forced to by SecondMarket and SharesPost and the lack of having the JOBS Act.
 Which is funny, because you were saying that while they were on the roadshow is when the JOBS Act got signed.
 Yeah.
 So the JOBS Act actually gets passed into law while theyre working on the IPO.
 So ironically, they could have avoided a lot of this pressure if they just waited a little bit.
 But, they didnt know that at the time.
 It really did seem like what would have happened otherwise.
 Like if they had stayed private, to their knowledge it wasnt going to get passed and they shouldnt count on it and they sort of were forced to IPO.
 If they had continued to wait longer, like actually were seeing a lot of companies do today, you run into these sort of issues where early investors need to get their money out and theyre going to, I dont know, do big secondaries and youre going to have the same sort of issues were having today with the superunicorns which we should talk about in tech themes.
 But, another big one that I think is worth talking about is the fact that they went under a tremendous amount of scrutiny by going public.
 Like this really forced management to understand every facet of the business and understand where their huge key risk factors were.
 I really think that the most interesting part of that S is where they identify risk to the business because truly, they probably were working on some of the mobile advertising stuff beforehand, but it is a huge slap in the face and like a huge wakeup call to realize our business has an existential crisis on its hands.
 So many other companies got destroyed in the wake of mobile.
 It was interesting that Facebook was able to kind of like keep their head above water until they really kind of came out and thrived.
 Yeah.
 I think its such a testament to Mark and Sheryl leading this company to do that because its kind of like a running joke in the industry that risk factors in Ss are like a joke.
 Like, You have to put them in there so lets make up some phony risk to our business that actually make us sound stronger.
 But part of I think because of all this disaster that the IPO process became, they had to really answer to what this risk meant and they saw literally half of the value of the company evaporate before their eyes.
 And, what stronger wakeup call could there be to understanding that they had a big problem there to fix.
 Right.
 I guess they could have priced lower and gotten the pop that they were looking for, maybe they just got ahead of their skeez a little bit and could have weathered this first year by pricing at getting a little pop up to like and then over the next months, then really kind of turning the gas on.
 And its interesting.
 They definitely could have done that, but like to what would have happened otherwise, would they then have noticed with the magnifying lens have been shown as brightly on how big a problem mobile was.
 And would they have again fixed the product, fixed the ad model, fixed the monetization model, invented a new ad unit within six months.
 Yeah.
 Pretty crazy.
 Pretty crazy.
 All right, tech themes.
 Yeah.
 Lets do it.
 The biggest thing that I think we both really want to talk about here, weve chat a little bit before the episode, this totally changed the way that tech companies IPO.
 It was the cultural touchstone according to Wikipedia.
 Which is of course, according to something else because Wikipedia makes no claims to be correct, but rather referenceable.
 Actually, it was referenced to, I forget what article labeled it a cultural touchstone.
 Yeah.
 But I mean, companies that were IPOing before were averaging years before they IPOd.
 Facebook went and had this total calamity on their hands.
 And, you know, we went through a pretty rough patch last year where there were just not a lot of tech IPOs and bleeding into early of this year.
 And, I think you can probably speak to this better than I can, but were definitely in a period where people are waiting longer now and that seems like you can kind of trace that back to Facebook.
 Its so interesting.
 I think one of the lessons that Silicon Valley and the tech world seems to have absorbed from the Facebook IPO is dont go public, its terrible.
 The IPO was indeed terrible as weve said.
 But whats so interesting is Zuck would be the first one to refute that.
 In his quote a year later at TechCrunch Disrupt, like it was great for the company, it forced them to really step up and play with the big boys, play in big boy land and big girl land.
 But the lesson thats been taken is totally opposite.
 So, Ben, you were referencing this.
 I pulled some numbers on some wellknown companies that went public before Facebook and how long between founding and when they went public.
 So, Zynga went public before Facebook, a couple months before,  years from founding to IPO.
 Which is crazy to think about.
 Zynga was built on the back of exploiting opportunities within Facebook.
 Right.
 Facebook may have been, whatever, or something, or Fifteen percent.
 Fifteen percent reliant on Zynga, but Zynga was reliant on Facebook.
 Yeah, exactly.
 When they moved, ran into big troubles when they tried to move off of Facebook and kind of control their entire ecosystem with their own website.
 Yeah.
 Realized they had no control.
 Another company, similarly, Groupon.
 Three years from founding to IPO.
 I was at the TechCrunch Disrupt when Andrew Mason was onstage and said never take your company public.
 Yeah.
 This was what entrepreneurs were internalizing from this.
 Zillow which we covered, years.
 Pandora,  years people thought that was a really long time to go from founding to public.
 The VCs were dying to get out of that company.
 LinkedIn, that we covered,  years.
 So that was kind of like the normal before Facebook.
 After Facebook, like you said, Ben, the really great companies haventeven gone public but the ones that have, like Etsy, years Shopify, years Fitbit,  years Atlassian,  years Trulia, years this year.
 People are staying private a really long time and not just staying private, but raising just absurd amounts of money.
 So, you know, Google, its so funny to see the evolution of the generations of tech companies and how they behave in the private markets.
 Generations in the last years.
 Well, generations in tech companies are about years.
 Its like going to college.
 Yeah.
 Google raised million before they went public.
 Facebook raised kind of to billion when you include that Goldman round before going public without the Goldman round, somewhere around a billion or so.
 Uber has now raised .
 billion over the years or so.
 Its insane that you can raise billion without having to be under the scrutiny of a public company.
 Thats totally the sighted advantage, is like we dont have to disclose all these things, its better for competitive reasons, but really, for a lot of these companies, they dont want to be part But the reality is its just worse for everybody.
 Yeah.
 Its worse for the companies because youre not accountable to these massive challenges that youre facing.
 Like, lets imagine, lets do another what would have happened otherwise for Uber.
 Lets say instead of raising the last couple of billion dollars Uber had gone public and was staring down this DD situation in China as a public company and would have been forced to really fix it.
 It turns out that hundreds of years of standard accounting principles and having to disclose in this very standard format, its actually quite good for keeping discipline for the business.
 Actually good for the company, yeah.
 And its not good for investors because investors now, the reason, you know, what youve seen since the Facebook IPO is obviously like the age of the unicorn has existed and thats twofold.
 Its one company staying private longer, not wanting to go public.
 But then related is that investors, all the people that were investing in these IPOs, their business model is predicated on getting cash into companies at this stage.
 So youve seen T.
 Rowe Price, youve seen Fidelity, youve seen Tiger Global the hedge fund, youve seen Dragoneer and XYZ other public market investors start doing late stage private venture rounds.
 Yup.
 Because thats what theyve always done.
 Its just now those deals are happening in private instead of in public.
 Its bad for the company, its bad for the investors because they dont get the disclosure.
 And its terrible for the public because you cant buy these stocks.
 Its really kind of antipatriotic.
 Follow me on this, but the American prosperity is built on the fact that for hundreds of years, American corporations have innovated.
 The computer, the internet, all these things that we conceived of and brilliant innovators in the US often because of our great public education system and a lot of the shared values of our culture.
 Having public markets allows for the everyday person to, you know, now its more like through mutual funds and index funds, or if you want to take a flyer on a company, but like benefit from the aggregate innovation.
 Wealth creation.
 That comes out of the American corporation.
 And it really freezes those people out.
 Really, if you want to really carry it forward sort of contributes to wealth polarization.
 Yeah, I think it absolutely does.
 I think there are two elements, as were seeing in this election cycle play out so viscerally, like income inequality and wealth inequality in America is more polarized than its ever been.
 Heres the crazy thing.
 Were sitting here on Monday night, our listeners will know the outcome of this election, where we do not.
 Were literally the night before the election here, which is also crazy.
 All that rioting outside that you hear, all the sirens and stuff is because of the Sea Hawks Monday night football game here in Pioneer Square, not because of the election.
 Night before the election.
 Seattle has its priorities either straight or completely wrong depending on how you view things.
 But yeah, part of that is that these entrepreneurs are creating these tech companies and theyre getting massively wealthy Mark Zuckerberg, Travis, and Airbnb guys and whatever.
 But its equally on the investor side too, like the people that are investing in these companies are so much more institutions now and for so much of the wealth creation period of these companies than they ever were so much more.
 Yeah.
 When you restrict the access to invest to people that already have the information and means to do so and large enough amounts of money to deploy, its a rich get richer scenario.
 And, yeah, its pretty crazy.
 Actually, to kind of continue this, thinking about tech trends or really like investment trends, with big institutionals coming down market and investing directly rather than deploying that capital into private equity and latestage venture, it kind of puts the squeeze on those industries.
 Oh yeah, absolutely.
 Theres a few things sort of contributing to this trend.
 Theres this notion that weve been talking about that companies want to go public later, but their investment vehicle is where large amounts of money can be deployed.
 So, large amounts of money will be deployed.
 Theres that thing going on.
 In the private markets.
 Exactly.
 Simultaneously, you have this market force thats fueling that which is over the sensitive element of the internet that the one thing thats always been true and that is, more information will be more available to more people than previously existed.
 So now its so much easier to get information than it previously was that institutional investors, VCs, and private equity firms would make the case to their limited partners, their investors saying, Look, I have information access and connections to these startups or these latestage companies that I will deploy this capital into, and I have unique access to that.
 Whereas, thats becoming less and less true.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 There is much more visibility into what companies are performing well and people can kind of go find them directly.
 Obviously, thats not entirely true.
 Theres still a very human element to all of this, but in general, it is easier to find out who is running a company and if that company is doing well, and reach out to them if you have an attractive offer to invest than ever has been before.
 I mean, I think about this every day being a venture capitalist.
 At the early stage, were somewhat insulated from this, somewhat, but only somewhat.
 Theres sort of three things that a venture capitalist does, and I had to make this up, but lotsof people talk about this.
 Principles of venture capital.
 One, find companies, great companies.
 Two, pick them decide if youre going to invest or not, if you think the company has high potential or not.
 But then, three, win the deal if its a competitive deal.
 It used to be like those three disciplines where all really important and now, like at least the belief is that its all about winning the deal.
 Its like oh, yeah, yeah, you can find companies easily and yeah, yeah, you can tell whats going to be successful and whats not.
 I mean, theres some judgement there but its kind of a commodity.
 But, its all about winning now.
 If thats the case and its really all about just getting the best deal, then it should be more entrepreneurfriendly and prices should go up, and it should be much more commoditized to the point where Which is exactly whats happened.
 Exactly.
 That investors effectively just get the minimum acceptable return that any of them are willing to deal with.
 Yup.
 At the late stage venture, this is what has happened over the last few years in the market, and its changing slightly on the margins.
 But, this has been a powerful force across all of venture and especially latestage venture in the past few years.
 All because of the Facebook IPO.
 Thanks, Mark and Sheryl.
 I dont know if were saying that exactly.
 All right.
 Should we bring it home?
 Yeah.
 Do you want to talk about how we thought about what our criteria would be for grading IPOs?
 Yeah, absolutely.
 The way that we normally grade an acquisition is through the lens of was it a good way to deploy that capital for the acquirer.
 So, we kind of close our eyes and dont really care about was it a good thing for the acquire because theyre getting a bunch of money, it was a great thing, and investors are cashing out, and almost every time that we analyze it, it was good.
 Yup.
 And we think a little bit about like the financial returns to the acquirer but were not spreadsheet jockeys here.
 Right.
 We think strategically, was this a good move for the acquirer.
 Yeah.
 And we think about did that acquisition both provide that financial return but sort of in a longer lead time scenario, was it something that made that a better, more lasting, more enduring, more valuable for longer company.
 And so, the way that we decided that were going to grade IPOs is through that same endurance lens.
 We want to assign this a grade based on the rubric of did it make this company a more lasting and enduring institution, a bigger competitive moat, make it a stronger, more viable, longlasting company.
 The way, we were talking about it before the show and I want to think about it, is like, was the IPO a springboard for the company, or a diving board.
 A lot of people thought the Facebook IPO was going to be a diving board.
 Yeah.
 So what that allows us to do is sort of zoom out from that terrible plunge in the first week plus the ensuing months.
 Really the whole year.
 For the first year, I mean, the stock below the IPO price.
 Right.
 And it allows us to look at the company as it exists today and look at that moment of IPO and say was that the right move for the company or not.
 With that rubric in mind, whats your grade on this?
 I am going to call this an A.
 A lot of that is based on how bullish I am on Facebook today, how great their strategy has been since the IPO, correcting for a lot of those blunders.
 The minus is because I am not convinced that all of the tumultuous times that they went through contributed to the success that they are today.
 I think that they could have gotten here they definitely needed the IPO.
 No doubt about it they needed to do that situation.
 But I think that they could have gotten to this point of hypergrowth and like kind of saturating the addressable human race with internet crux that theyre at today, I think they could have done that without such a bungled year.
 No doubt it was a bungled year.
 Im not so sure.
 Im going to give this, probably unsurprisingly giving my enthusiasm during the history and facts, Im going to give this an A because I think they wouldnt have and I think had they not gone through that year and had this massive, you know, megawatts spotlight shown on them, they wouldnt have moved so fast to plug the mobile hole.
 And it wasnt just a hole, like it was a chest wound, and built, like we said, not just the product but the whole business and advertising model and invented native advertising practically within six months.
 I agree with you, I think they could have done it eventually, but had they not moved so fast because of this, with the heavy loss.
 And the other thing thats in my mind here, clearly May was the pivotal moment for the Facebook IPO when things really started to go south.
 And these cracks started getting exposed.
 But I got to imagine that the whole process was really in Mark and Sheryls minds, starting to expose some of this stuff.
 And, what if they had not bought Instagram in April?
 If they had not bought Instagram and not moved so quickly to plug these holes, would there be a future or an alternate present today where Instagram had remained an independent company, had become the Facebook of mobile and figured out native advertising, and completely eaten Facebooks lunch.
 I mean, so if you look at Facebooks revenue over the last couple of years, essentially the desktop Facebook is completely flatted down over the last four years.
 What was their whole business, this meteoric rise that made them the most hyped IPO ever, the largest technology IPO ever, that business is essentially dead?
 And like you said, of their advertising now is mobile.
 What if that were, you know, half, a third, a quarter, a fifth, or a tenth of what it is today, and Instagram were the gorilla in mobile advertising?
 Yeah.
 I mean, theres a whole lot of things they would need to go right there.
 A whole lot of things, for sure.
 They would need to have a Sheryl Sandberg whos going to build this operational advertising sales business.
 You would need well, its actually really interesting looking at So Twitter didnt have this crux, right?
 Yeah.
 And Twitter was always, you know, if not mobile native, like it was built for mobile.
 Yeah.
 Its text messaging, right?
 Yeah.
 And you look at their transition to the smartphone world and, I mean, Twitter still doesnt have a great ad unit.
 Theres a lot of problems going on there and were kind of seeing it all fall apart in front of our eyes.
 But a large part of it is its just never Facebook ads are way more compelling particularly on mobile.
 And you raised this interesting point like if Facebook didnt feel this existential crisis, could they wind up in a Twitterlike situation, maybe not with engagement but with monetization.
 Yep.
 Or even maybe not Instagram, but Ill throw it out there, you know it was February when Facebook filed its S.
 One year later, February Snapchat is founded.
 So you know, one of the greatest things I love the most about our industry is, it is so hyper competitive.
 I think this is just such a great case study of why you cant rest on your heels even when you are the largest tech IPO in history because man, the next generation is coming right after you.
 Yup.
 All right.
 Speaking of Twitter, followups.
 Twitter lots going on on Twitter these days.
 But theyre shutting down Vine, potentially selling Vine.
 Yeah, no surprise there.
 I mean, its shocking to me that they havent and I think these will come but they had like layoffs.
 It seems like theres a lot more of that to come.
 They got to streamline their products.
 Its kind of shocking to me that they didnt do Periscope too in one fell swoop.
 I think the reason thats probably living on is because Facebook Live is proving so the future of Facebook that Twitter is really afraid to exit that race when Facebook is making such a big bet on it.
 Total aside by the way, related to Facebook.
 It gets a lot of press but not in this context.
 Facebook is kind of trying to do this again, everything were just talking about, and thats reinventing itself around video.
 I think yeah, theres an existential thing where they totally and VR.
 They totally fear missing the next boat since they almost missed the mobile boat.
 So like, buy Oculus and be way ahead of the curve on that.
 Try to buy Snapchat, yeah.
 And Snapchat is mobile and I just made that analogy like oh, could Snapchat have killed Facebook in mobile.
 But, Snapchat is also video.
 Right.
 Yeah, so for me, tough to do.
 You never want to kill products that people love.
 But, Im rooting for Twitter to survive at all here.
 And so, I think they need a lot more belt tightening to get there.
 To me, theyre in this very difficult situation where all the investors are super excited that they might sell, so that sort of pushes the price up, and then that price tag ends up being too expensive, so theyre in this like weird catch where they were unsuccessful in finding a buyer and now they have to go figure it out.
 And theyve already gone public.
 Right.
 We need to a third category to the show, which is like, what happens if youve already gone public, you have no buyer.
 Plan C.
 Yeah.
 Its an invaluable product to the world and I really want it to endure.
 And its actually a pretty good business, like they sell a lot of ads and there are reasons why people use Twitter ads and cant necessarily satisfy that or any other platform.
 Its a good business its a Facebook sized business and they really need to reduce their cost to get it to a place where it can actually live on sustainably.
 I agree.
 Quick followup on Skype, our last episode.
 We speculated on the show that Microsoft might have used foreign cash to buy Skype which was a nonUS company, and it turns out that is indeed the case, was indeed the case.
 We were pointed in this direction by Nick Seguin, dear friend of Ben and the show, helped us a lot in the early days with feedback on the pilot.
 Thanks, Nick.
 Thanks, Nick.
 And he pointed us to an old blog post that he wrote after acquisition about talking with a friend about this.
 And yes, turns out Microsoft did use cash that it was holding overseas to buy Skype and so I got a massive I was able to essentially repatriate that cash taxfree, thing got a massive tax benefit for it.
 So, definitely plays into how you should think about the Skype acquisition.
 Yeah.
 If I recall, not only did they avoid paying approximately to repatriate that capital, but then theres that second advantage too.
 Yes, there is that second advantage and thats what is apparently referred to as the deadly D that they can repatriate apparently up to another .
 billion of cash taxfree, which at a tax rate is worth .
 billion to them.
 So, in theory, perhaps Microsoft is getting about billion in tax credits out of a value out of the Skype deal.
 Pretty wild.
 And thats eyeopening for me.
 If a USbased company uses overseas capital to make a purchase overseas, they can repatriate that same amount of capital back kind of in exchange for deploying that capital in an acquisition.
 Its really interesting to start thinking about other companies that have huge amounts of cash overseas Apple, Microsoft, and actually, most big tech companies at this point.
 Google.
 Yeah, all of them.
 Facebook.
 And what they could possibly do.
 Interesting.
 Any corporate tax lawyers out there who know any more about this?
 Truly wed love to hear from you.
 Wed love to hear from you.
 Let us know.
 All right, Carve Out.
 Carve Out.
 So I was chatting with some of the listeners in Slack.
 If you like to join the Slack, go to Acquired.
fm and you can sign up there.
 We were talking about the Internet History podcast.
 Oh so good.
 This is an awesome, awesome podcast where I believe its Brian McCullough, brianmcc on Twitter.
 Its like a hundred episodes or more.
 Its super long.
 Yeah, this is so good.
 If you like Acquired, you will love the Internet History podcast.
 Yeah, particularly the story part.
 I started listening to the show a year ago and its sort of like longform reading but just having it sort of read to you and he starts out with the story of the Netscape IPO dating all the way back to the founding and the Mosaic project and Marc Andreessen, and really, all the incredible drama in there.
 The episode that I just listened to, that I love, that had all sorts of interesting nuggets about the founding of Amazon, with Amazons technical cofounder and Employee Shel Kaphan.
 Its so interesting to get the engineers perspective on the founding of Amazon because in the ensuing years, you kind of get the version of it thats in the everything store, you get Jeff talking about it on stage.
 It really is like not quite revisionist history, not quite sensationalized but definitely through the eyes of and through the lens of what Amazon is today.
 And Shel left Amazon a few years after they founded it and sort of he almost feels like his viewpoint is frozen in time.
 And you really get to hear not only the perspective of someone who remembers just that piece of Amazon history extremely vividly, but hes also one of those just super endearing, oldschool engineers, and the way that he talks about, Oh well, we were using an Oracle database that had never seen these major transactions before, so it crashed that, and I wasnt an Oracle guy, so we were just kind of making it work.
 Its awesome to hear about all of these really early stage Amazon stories about when they were kind of patching it altogether in the early days of the web.
 So, whether youre an engineer or not, I think anybody listening to the show will love that episode.
 Totally.
 Like we said, let us know too if you like the IPO addition to the show.
 If you guys do, we go forward with it.
 Were definitely going to have to do Amazon at some point.
 Absolutely.
 No shortage of drama in that IPO either.
 Nope.
 Okay, my Carve Out for the week, I thought it would be appropriate given that we covered Facebook today, is a relatively new book by Parag Khanna called Mapping the Future of Global Civilization that I read.
 This is a really good book.
 And basically, its like a geopolitical, which usually is not what Im into, but I had it recommend to me, and its great.
 Basically, the thesis of the book is that what the axis of power in the world, like geopolitically, are not nation states and borders and geography and land or even population that much anymore its connectivenessconnectivity.
 And that the more connected a nation state is whether its physically with supply chains for industry or oil pipelines or water or electricity, the more connected they are to ideas and to trade, also very relevant to the election that is happening tomorrow, as we record this That happened in the past for all of you.
 And happened in the past for all of you.
 Anyway, the argument is that the more connected a nation state is, the more powerful it will be and really, nobody gets this better right now than China.
 And if you look at a lot of Chinas foreign policy, the Silk Road and the essentially trading block that theyre forming in Asia, its all kind of based on this and its delivering, creating massive power and influence for them.
 Anyway, great book.
 Totally related to Facebook connecting the world.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Well, thats it for today.

  may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate andor amusing transcription errors Welcome, Acquired LPs.
 I think this will probably be our last LP Episode of .
 Very exciting.
 Im excited for to be over, but we have a great topic and a great guest of looking forward to in a nonCoronavirus world.
 We can keep all our fingers crossed.
 Amir Salihefendic from doist.
com, and Todoist, and Twist, which were all going to get into.
 Ben and I have been long time Todoist users and Ben has spun Todoist productivity stories from his own history well get into.
 Amir both started an iPhone based todo list app before I did and continued far after I did.
 Here you are being a podcaster and venture capitalist.
 You could be doing much better if youd stuck with it.
 Its true.
 If only I had kept bootstrapping, but I think well get into that.
 Well get into that.
 Amir has bootstrapped Doist, which is what well talk about at the top of the show but more setting the stage at the topic we really want to cover, which is youve built a now close to person totally remote global company before Coronavirus, before that was cool, before Gitlab.
 Were going to talk about what it looks like as all of us start making decisions hopefully next year about what our companies are going to look like, where we are going to work, how we are going to work, what new companies we might start in the future may look like.
 Were going to talk to Amir about how to do it right.
 Welcome to the show and thanks for joining us.
 Folks, thank you for having me.
 It should be said that Im a huge fan of the show.
 I actually found it a few months ago and I have been binging ever since.
 Im really a huge fan.
 The depth that goes into this is really something.
 I really appreciate the work you folks do.
 I hope I can contribute and get some content that maybe people will not find elsewhere.
 Im sure you can.
 In our prep call, listeners, David and I have had loosely on our agenda for a while to do something about how to do remote work right, but everyone seems to have the same things to say and heres the three tools you use.
 In the minutes of talking with Amir, were like, oh weve been thinking about this wrong and weve been thinking about remote work as were in the mesozoic era of the tools necessary to make remote good and I think its like remote trying to impersonate an impersonal world.
 Amir, I just really like how you guys think about it and really thinking about lets forget the concept of an office and the concept of everybody synchronously being in the same room.
 How would you work if you have never ever had that constraint.
 Youve been at it for years, is that right?
 Yeah.
 I actually have never really had a proper job, like an office job.
 I have only been like a student and a programmer at the university.
 Other than that, I have never had a proper office job.
 I dont actually like when I slam office work.
 I could just imagine how bad it is.
 I have never actually tried it out for real.
 I think this kind of disruption of work, and the second and third order effects of this will be huge.
 My vision of this is quite extreme, but I think its maybe based on the verge of being another industrialization because its the first time in human history where you can get an amazing job regardless of where you live.
 Implication of that is just very, very significant.
 People have been saying this, likewise with that Im so glad we waited to do this because people have been talking about this idea for a long time.
 Youve been evangelizing it to us.
 We even had Wade from Zapier on the show in February right before the pandemic and we spent five minutes on remote work.
 Its like, yeah, you can get a great job anywhere.
 It makes sense.
 Kind of buzzy topic of working remote organizations, blah, blah, blah.
 Tell us about Zapier.
 Before we get into the meat of the topic hereto set the right contextwe have to tell a little bit of the Doist story.
 Can you take us quickly through this?
 Going from student to your time in Chile and starting this as a side project, how did you end up now running this company?
 Lets talk also about the scale that youre at because I think thats important.
 Like Ben, I also wanted to do a todo app.
 A lot of developers, they do that.
 You create a dummy todo app and I did that as well.
 The thing I did basically after that is continue working on it for years now.
 Its a very sophisticated Hello, World!
 Exactly, yeah.
 Honestly, when I started out this todo app I didnt really do it to do a business.
 It wasnt a starter for me.
 It was just a side project that I wanted to do for myself.
 Thats basically the framing of that.
 It took me actually four years to make it into a real company.
 Basically I was working on this on the side.
 It survived for four years.
 When I actually hired a support person, it was because I really didnt want to answer more support emails, especially some of the early people.
 Some of them are still using the software and I actually know some of them.
 They will send me pages of feedback of stuff that didnt work, that should have improved, and I was just like, oh no.
 Even right now, we have actually hired some people to send me feedback and they essentially send me pages.
 I just reply, We are not going to do that.
 Way to listen to the users.
 I think thats exactly what people are supposed to do.
 If we have our timelines right, it was when you started this as a project.
 Then, you started a social media project.
 It was in when you came back to this.
 You made your first hire and you thought maybe this could be a good thing.
 Exactly.
 Basically, I started Todoist and then actually had some success.
 I even had a business model where it was profitable.
 But then, I got a really good offer to be a cofounder and CTO of a social network.
 I jumped into that and we basically competed early on with Twitter.
 We lost that battle.
 What was it called?
 Its called Plurk.
 Its actually still running.
 It has about people hired in Taiwan.
 Its mainly really big in Taiwan still and also some other Asian countries.
 That was basically it.
 I actually almost burned out on doing the social network because it was super stressful.
 I basically worked all the time and we didnt have a business model.
 We were raising money and selling the thing.
 It was just so much stress.
 I actually thought at some point I would be something and be a multimillionaire.
 Those dreams just unraveled and it never really became real.
 Which is why when I came back to start the real company, I was just like, I dont want to stress again.
 I want to build this on my own pace, build a culture I actually want to work in for decades.
 Thats why I like this bootstrap mentality and also not raising money.
 I actually could have raised money early on for Todoist as well.
 I spoke to a very famous Silicon Valley VC and one of the first things they wanted to do is replace me as a CEO.
 You mentioned was that actually in the term sheet?
 He wanted me to meet some potential CEOs that could come in and replace me.
 Let me guess, friends of the firm?
 Yeah, exactly.
 I was like Im not going to sign up for that.
 Was this early in Doists life or was this later after you already had revenue and scale?
 It was early on.
 It was I think maybe .
 It was before maybe I started on the social network.
 So it was really early.
 It was really early.
 They were visionary, but they didnt really believe I could actually be a good CEO.
 And maybe they were right.
 What has the company evolved to today?
 Give us a sense.
 I think youre profitable, right?
 We have actually been profitable every year since we started and we are about people.
 Growth has never been a huge thing.
 We dont actually have milestones that we want to hit and stuff like that.
 Its kind of very controlled as well.
 To be clear, youve never raised any money.
 Theres no outside capital in Doist.
 Exactly.
 Probably to a bunch of listeners, it sounds a little crazy to say you dont have milestones of growth, but you dont have to.
 You have to operate profitably because theres no capital in the business.
 As long as that happens, you dont have to be racing ahead to go raise your next round to stay alive, right?
 Exactly.
 Honestly, that was something thats very important for us.
 A lot of our competitorswe have somelike Monday is one example where you burn millions per month on ads, and you have this unit economics that doesnt really make sense and stuff like that.
 Maybe also the culture that you have is very broken.
 If you combine all of that, we dont think its worth it.
 Of course, we have huge ambitions.
 We do want to have impact.
 We are really, really hard on ourselves with regards to the product, to the quality, and also maybe to our growth.
 But its not like if we dont hit million in revenues next year, we will be very unhappy.
 Its a different model and I think its more sustainable.
 The reason why I can optimize for that is I know I will spend decades on this.
 For me, theres no exit in mind, and I dont want to burn out five years into this.
 To give further context, to me, the people behind Todoist were a big company, because it was software that I have been using for a long time, loved, and felt solid.
 I dont know how to define the company other than that.
 How many users do you have?
 It was a single product company for a long time.
 When did you decide to become a two product company?
 Give us some more of the info there.
 We started with this todo app and then we find out actually this is a much, much bigger problem because most of the way that we currently organize ourselves and our teams is completely broken.
 I still think like this today even if you have Asana and stuff like that.
 Its kind of a very broken tool that we still have for this.
 Its a really, really deep problem that we have not solved yet either, so we are still working on solving that problem.
 But then, we were a fully remote company and we actually use Slack.
 But that was kind of a very, very bad experience, especially if you have many time zones and you have to be connected all the time.
 We also tried to promote deep work inside a company.
 This means when you actually do something, you should be able to focus on it fully.
 This idea of being disrupted all the time, being on this chat channel all day long, it was really not promoting the type of environment that we want to foster.
 Then we looked at the environment and nobody actually had any tool for this to promote more deep work and asynchronous communication as the default.
 Thats why we actually did Doist.
 If you read any books or any strategy, its basically a very stupid idea because you have something thats growing.
 Today, its growing over per year when we actually committed to Twist.
 We started on a project with competitors that have billions in valuations and we have trillion dollar competitors.
 The reason for this is basically, we dont really believe the model of the future is synchronous communication.
 We believe asynchronous is the default.
 I think were being proven a bit right and its really hard because we have been preaching this for the last five years.
 Yesterday, Paul Graham promoted a bit asynchronous, first on Twitter and urged companies like startups to innovate in this field, which is maybe a bit bad for us, but I think thats good for the whole community.
 Thats great.
 For context for people who arent familiar, Todoist is the todo app and you can use it personally, just yourself, but also in an organization across teams, which I assume you use internally at Doist as your main project management software.
 But then, was it five years ago that you launched Twist?
 Yeah.
 Basically on Todoist we kind of have productmarket fit.
 On Twist, we didnt and we still dont have a strong market pull because its super early.
 I think companies that run asynchronous as default are probably under maybe that have more than employees, so its super niche.
 The companies that do this are very special, like GitLab, Basecamp, Buffer, Zapier.
 Im pretty sure this will be something that will be more common hopefully as this space matures.
 If Im saying I just took my office toolset with me and now Im an employee at a remote company, and I say, great, Ive got my email, Ive got my Slack.
 Ive got my Zoom, and then theres some project management system of recordAsana, Smartsheet, Todoist, or whateverwhats wrong with that and how does your vision of the way a remotefirst company can and should be run?
 How is it different from what were all sort of experiencing right now?
 Thats a very good question, Ben.
 Honestly, I dont think we have reached this stage yet.
 I think we are still some years from actually reaching the stage where we have to stack the new stack.
 Maybe we can try to draw a parallel to Git.
 Im not sure if listeners know what it is, but its basically a distributed versioning system.
 In the beginning, when you actually did development and collaborated with other people, you would actually send patches over, or files, even .
 Then, you need to merge them manually.
 You even got something like Subversion or something like that that was a bit smarter, but there was still merging files in and it was a really, really bad model.
 Then, Git got born.
 Actually, Gits history is very interesting because it was born in the Linux kernel.
 If you look at the first commits of Git, Linus who created Linux actually created Git.
 He did that in a few, I think on a weekend or something like that.
 Its insane.
 The thing is that Git and GitHub, which is basically built on top of Git, has basically changed the developing world totally.
 Nobody would develop today without a distributed versioning system.
 Everybody knows, but actually when it started out, it was freaking hard to use.
 The only development team that used it were Linux developers, which were hired experts.
 To really pile onto that, in my early development days, I was using CVS, and then SVN or Subversion.
 That was all centralized.
 There was only one source of truth.
 You would check it out, you would work on it, and then youd check it back in.
 It was sane.
 When Git came out or became popular before the advent of GitHub to sort of recentralization in a cloud location, it was this crazy concept that everybody could have their own version of the code that they could be working from locally and then from any node could be shared, like any other developer to any other developer, like here, clone mine.
 It was this crazy, multicrossing, decentralized work and you did really need something like GitHub to come along and sort of recentralize it, not in the same way that Subversion was, but in a way that you could then make sense of who was working on what across your team.
 Yeah and thats basically where we are stranded with work.
 I think work is still in the preGit days.
 What we basically need is this new stack that can replace this.
 I think you can see a lot of inefficiency in how we organize, how we communicate, how we share knowledge.
 Everybody is just patching it and hoping for the best.
 Even if you read about remote work, a lot of it is kind of just taking the office paradigm and moving to digital.
 Its not like building a whole stack for the digital world.
 A lot of innovation needs to happen here.
 Packy McCormick, who Chris just did a collaboration with on the Slack episode relevant for this, wrote this piece the other week on Not Boring, about I think he called it, were not going back.
 Remote is the future now.
 He looked at some of the software thats being built right now, like remote HQ software.
 Some of it is literally skeuomorphic, like a little video game version of an office space.
 That doesnt seem right.
 It reminds me so much of the early Internet where its like, what does a newspaper look like online?
 Basically a scannedin version of the newspaper in a web browser.
 Or what is a mobile app look like?
 We took your desktop app and we jammed it onto your phone.
 I think the famous example of this is that the first movies were recorded stage performances.
 Once you move into a new medium, it takes some time to figure out what is native to that medium.
 Amir, this is the first time Ive thought about remote as a medium and figuring out what does native mean to the remote medium versus adapting our previous life.
 You guys have been doing this now for a decade.
 What does it look like at Doist?
 I think remote is the spectrum where you have office real time.
 Then you have these hybrid setups.
 Then on the extreme addition, you have remote first, asynchronous first.
 Where we have actually operated since maybe the last five years is asynchronous first and remote first.
 I did an interview with Superorganizers, I think its calledits another newsletterwhere he titled it, The CEO with an empty calendar.
 Such a great .
 Well link to it.
 Basically, what you dont have that many meetings.
 Theres a lot of deep work thats involved.
 You can structure your days as you like.
 Something that the Not Boring article didnt get correct is this is not only good for the life of people its also good for work.
 Honestly, we are doing knowledge work where creativity and focus is actually the most central part.
 A lot of office environments and even digital real time environments are not optimized for the focused and deep work.
 I also think remote first thing is really also optimizable.
 Its designers, writers, coders.
 Even our finance people.
 Everybody inside of the company, people ask people.
 They ask asynchronous first.
 They think before they say something.
 Something else to know is we actually hired our first HR person last year.
 We have had zero HR issues or something like that because in an asynchronous environment, you dont have these.
 Of course, you can have themwe are all humansbut its much more common in a real time environment where you can have people going in a flame war and insulting each other.
 Like the Coinbase Slack that got out of control.
 Maybe this is a good place to double click then on what exactly does operating asynchronously mean?
 You do it through Twist.
 What is Twist and why is it not Slack or email?
 Something to know is I think actually the culture is much more important than actually the tools that you use, but the tools are also important.
 I read somewhere that the tools that we use shape us and I think thats very critical as well.
 Something to note about, its like a written culture.
 Gitlab is an extreme version of this where they have the handbook thats pages long and updated by everybody in some company.
 But its kind of the culture of doing so.
 Actually, inside Twist, we have about .
 million messages.
 Everything is indexed, searchable, and transparent.
 Even leadership discussions, like most things.
 Actually the only thing that isnt really public is the salaries of people.
 Ill cite we have made a mistake there, but everything else is public.
 I think the written is really dominant and great writers are really the people that get promoted and get great communicators.
 Also something with remotefirst and asynchronousfirst is it will change the dynamics inside of companies because extraversion, being likable will maybe not matter as much as the stuff that you say, the impact you have and stuff like that.
 How is iteither in the culture or in the toolsetup then that it doesnt devolve into Slack where its like as people communicate back and forth, it just becomes this chat?
 My email has turned into this, especially if somebody responds right away to my email, then you set this expectation that this is now a real time channel until one of us decides to break that contract.
 If anything, Superhuman is making email more like this.
 Do you try to design constraints into both your software and your culture to discourage real timeness without an explicit optin from both sides?
 Exactly.
 Design patterns matter a lot.
 For instance, something that we dont have is you cant see when somebody is online, you cant see when they were last online, you cant see what they have seen and what they havent seen.
 This kind of discouraged real time communication between people.
 Thats just like one pattern.
 Another pattern is for instance in our comments or chats, you have a huge text box.
 That does not really say, write a oneliner here.
 Its kind of like, write content here.
 As a product designer, you can do stuff like that to encourage more long form.
 But then again, I think the culture matters a lot as well.
 Of course, you can still have people posting oneliners and Im pretty sure some Twist users do that.
 If people go in and see huge threads with a lot of content, they will not go in and slam in it to begin to post one liners.
 I think expectations and culture matters a lot as the tools do.
 Where does real time communication have its place in your company?
 Thats also something we have experimented with.
 We have actually tried to do fully only asynchronousfirst until our head of marketing said, guys, I have completely lost touch with people because You went really down the rabbit hole on this.
 I can tell you asynchronousonly does not really work.
 Its great as the default way but I still think you need to have meetings with people.
 For instance, oneonones are synchronous.
 Also most teams have synchronous meetings, like weekly meetings where were just checking, you can see the people that youre working with.
 Honestly, I think even for asynchronousfirst and remotefirst, meetings in person are really, really critical as well.
 What we have done from early on is retreats.
 Honestly, this has been some of the most rewarding and fun times because basically you work with people for a year, then you see them, and then magic happens because we are humans after all.
 The human connection is very important.
 Before COVID, we also did team retreats.
 Our teams organize their own retreats.
 Some have done it, and a lot of them like these retreats.
 We try to make them fun.
 We have been to Iceland, Chile, and just flown a lot of people around the world.
 I think for remotefirst and asynchronousfirst, these are some of the biggest perks as well is basically creating these retreats.
 It probably puts a lot of the heavy lifting on making sure you really are thoughtful about the agenda and the schedule when youre doing these, because if its only once a year that people actually have an opportunity to be in person, I assume that means you have to be very structured or very thoughtful about how you plan that.
 Actually, some of the stuff that we do, we dont work a lot.
 Its mostly just hanging around with people, getting some good food, seeing some things, and doing some stuff.
 What we had done, almost every retreat is like a football tourney, which is really great.
 A lot of people dont play that well but its still very fun.
 Theres two things Ive been thinking about that we havent called out in discussing this but I think are important, are the football comments.
 Thats soccer for you Americans.
 Exactly.
 You mentioned times, how many time zones and how many countries are Doist employees in right now?
 I think we are in different countries.
 Im not sure about time zones, but we are all over the world.
 Something to also note, what we have not done and some like Zappier, they have mostly hired in the US, which makes things much easier.
 We have hired all around the world.
 Youre dealing with taxes, legal issues, and employment across countries.
 Yeah.
 Honestly, I think most people are not really dealing with that and neither are we.
 We are only dealing with that in the US because we are a USbased company.
 Other than that, its basically independent contractors.
 They figure it out and we pay them to get accountants and stuff.
 Thats actually the most common way to do that.
 Of course, theres a lot of work thats being done by remote, for instance to streamline this.
 I think Im pretty sure I see a lot of innovation in this space.
 Remote the company that handles the onboarding HR, all the technical components of HR for the employment model?
 Exactly, yeah.
 Its amazing to just step back and think about this.
 Youve got people all over the world speaking all these different languages in all these different countries, all these different time zones.
 You bring everybody together and youre going to play football because thats the global game and youre going to call it football.
 This asynchronous culture and way of working, I have to imagine it just grew out of that.
 Theres no way you could make real time chat work when for a significant portion of your colleague, its the middle of the night for them at any given moment in time.
 Exactly.
 Honestly, I think this timezone issue is just one aspect of that.
 I think another aspect and Im sure you have read Paul Grahams Makers Schedule, Managers Schedule.
 The thing we do is most are makers.
 We dont actually have any almost pure managers.
 I think we only have one person inside a company.
 But even he does stuff that is actually more IC work.
 Thats the problem.
 If youre deep into something, you dont want to get disrupted in your day.
 Thats also a huge component.
 Also for me, as a leader of this asynchronousfirst, remotefirst, using Slack, I would actually need to be connected all the time.
 If I wasnt connected, I would get nightmares and look at Slack to see if some discussion is going without me and stuff like that.
 It really creates very, very bad habits where you basically cant disconnect and this is also really bad as well.
 Amir, youre the CEO of a person company thats growing year over year.
 Are you a maker or a manager at this point?
 How do you structure your work?
 I tried to stop development for many years now.
 I also have a coach.
 Last year, we did a review of myself.
 There are a lot of people who said, Amir, stop doing encoding.
 We need a CEO.
 I have actually tried to do less of that because honestly, I love to develop.
 I love to create stuff.
 I dont love to manage people.
 That said, in order for the company to succeed, for myself to succeed, I need to manage people and stop doing development.
 I managed that.
 Then, I saw Toby from Shopify.
 He does two hours of development per day, what they say.
 With maybe I just need to figure out how to do this because for me, if I lose the creativity part, then it becomes a very dull job.
 Regardless of how big Twist is, if Im not happy and satisfied, Im trying to limit it.
 Thats the answer to that.
 I guess it was a leading question because I think one way Im going to keep structuring this is Im going to think of things that I have to do synchronously, or in person, or in a video call and then Im going to ask you how you do them.
 Youre trying to do more management and more be a CEO and code less.
 How do you interact with your directs?
 Do you have weekly oneonones?
 Do you do those over video chat?
 How does that work?
 Honestly, something that we really encourage a lot is oneonones.
 We do them biweekly, but its actually up to leaders themselves to structure how they want to do it.
 I do them biweekly.
 I think they are great tools.
 Actually, when we implemented that, it was probably one of the biggest advancements for our company.
 Of course, you can maybe do it in an asynchronous way, but its worth spending an hour on just meeting with the person that you work with.
 How do you deal with that if, lets say theres a product manager, engineer, or designer, a team and they are each eight hours apart?
 On the one hand, its really good if its really humming because work can be done hours a day and just shift it across the globe.
 On the other hand, if theres a blocker issue, how do you deal with that as a company when the person that you need to ask a question to is no longer working?
 In an asynchronous environment, youre blocked by default.
 Youll figure out very quickly that you need to have some other stuff on your plate as well if youre blocked until that gets resolved.
 Some stuff moves slower because of that, but most of the time its not really a problem.
 That said, something where we can see its a huge problem is if you have inexperienced people, like junior people coming in, they need a lot of handholding.
 They can be blocked almost all the time.
 You really need to have people that are independent and more senior authorities to work.
 We are still trying to figure out how we make mentorship, and how junior people work and evolve in this type of environment.
 Maybe here, you actually need to have synchronized time zones and more synchronous communication.
 Thats very interesting.
 Thinking about these companies that just went remote forever or remote optional forever, they are big companies.
 I may get the company wrong, but I think Microsoft just for their whole engineering or RD org said its okay to never come back to the office.
 How on earth is that going to work at companies at that scale that have a thousand college new hires that start every week?
 I think a lot of people will have really, really bad experiences with remote work because you need to have the whole setup, the whole culture in place.
 If you dont have that then I think youll basically have bad outcomes.
 Another thing to note is how you evaluate work also changes.
 For us, for instance, our leaders are experts at what they do.
 Theres a reason for that.
 You cant just have a pure manager that doesnt really evaluate the work properly.
 They dont really know what a good design is, what is bad design, what is good code, what is bad code.
 That answers this question of how do you know that people are working.
 If you have an expert that is managing you, they will look at the output and say this is garbage.
 I cant believe you spent one week on this.
 Its very easy to do that, but its very hard to do that if you dont really know the subject in a deep way.
 I think it really changes the leadership role as well.
 There are a lot of implications that are just all over the place.
 How do you set expectations when people come into Doist?
 I would imagine almost everybody who comes in has never worked in this mindset or modality before.
 What do you do to prevent a smaller scale version of this example of a thousand new college grads coming into Microsoft, like this is a recipe for disaster?
 I think thats where something like the handbook comes in play.
 We also have our own handbook.
 We actually started that only last year, but it has already been a huge game changer.
 I definitely understand why GitLab even has a fulltime person and maybe even a team working on the handbook.
 You really need to have a lot of stuff documented.
 For instance, for us, a big shift was core values and really also not selecting some core values that arent your core values.
 Just some aspirational thing that is in some document somewhere, but what do we really care about and then document that.
 People that are new in the organization are going to read the document and say this is what they care about.
 Our core values touch almost everything else inside the company, including how we compensate people and stuff like that.
 Its a free world that goes through that.
 For instance, one of the values that we value a lot is mastery, growth, learning.
 Another thing is communication and independence.
 These are really, really important stuff.
 Communication and independence are really also important for the environment that we work in because if youre not independent, you get blocked, and you cant resolve it, you could basically be blocked for days ahead of time.
 Youre not going to succeed in this modality.
 Yeah.
 Im assuming that your goto market strategy is mostly productled growth.
 You dont have sales people.
 Youre not primarily a salesdriven organization.
 Is that right?
 We dont have a single sales person.
 Thats a problem.
 I try not to exaggerate.
 Again, Im asking these leading questions.
 Do you think this works uniquely for you?
 You have a whole company of makers.
 You dont really need to be clientfacing, you dont really need to do a lot of the things that require the most human interaction, and everybody can be largely independent and creative.
 Yeah.
 I still think were learning on this front.
 I would actually love for us to bring in a sales team and maybe even try to innovate on the sales function.
 If you read what popular venture capitalists tell you is dont innovate sales, just hire a COO.
 Why dont we innovate on sale?
 How do you compensate for that as well and stuff like that?
 Thats still something that we need to explore.
 We would love to become much better at that.
 At this current stage, we have been way too focused on building great products, bringing sales as well.
 It just feels very overwhelming, but I hope we can do that soon.
 I was actually thinking a lot in preparing for this and when Ben asked the question about sales in this modality.
 Ive never worked directly in sales, but we do sales at Acquired, we get exposed to it, VC sells in its own way.
 I actually wonder if sales is a perfect candidate for this type of work, because it should be output focused.
 Thats all that matters.
 Did you make the sale?
 Did you hit your quota?
 If you were able to culturally land this, I wonder if it would be a lot more productive as a sales organization to have it be purely outcomefocused versus we all probably know and have observed a lot of sales organizations that instantly become political.
 Youve got all these hypercompetitive people looking for attribution on this deal or that deal.
 Obviously, this wouldnt work for every type of sales approach, but I think it could work for a lot.
 I think youre right.
 This needs to get explored and challenged.
 You have three nonsales guys sitting around hyperbolizing about how this is great for sales.
 If youre listening to this, join us in the Slack and let us know how you can make this work at your company.
 Well again, I think it depends on the type of sales.
 Something like Doisteither Todoist or TwistI can totally imagine this is an individual person selling this.
 I dont know that you would need a whole wide team, but of course youd have to collaborate across sales and marketing.
 If you can have reps in every country in the worldnot just physical location but of every set of networks and type of target companies that they have networks that have backgrounds inand they can just be focused on that and not worry about all the other stuff, that sounds pretty good to me.
 Well, Im inspired.
 I think the problem for me is sales isnt really a strong suit.
 What I think is maybe a good idea isnt really a great one.
 The thing I think about is trying it out.
 Maybe if you just follow the standard playbook, maybe youll actually not fully succeed because everybody else is doing that.
 Its like trying something out of the ordinary could maybe be a good strategy.
 Amir, Im curious how do you acquire customers and how has that changed over time?
 We have been very lucky with tapping in some very powerful distribution channels which are free, so SEO if you search for todo list, we are going to be at the top on all the search engines the app stores as well.
 We actually dont do any paid marketing and everything is organic.
 To what do you attribute having that really good SEO?
 The name.
 Honestly, I think of the name randomly, but the thing is Todoist and todo list are very, very similar.
 It should not surprise me if the engines actually think that we are todolist.
com and not todoist.
com.
 That couldve gone either way.
 They couldve thought it was a typo.
 I will tell you, I am frustrated on a multiple time per week basis because I will sayeverybodys phones are going to go offHey Siri, and Ill say, remind me to blah, blah, blah in Todoist.
 Siri thinks and then Siri back and says, great, I added it to your reminders.
 Itll literally say like in Todoist in my thing that I just accidentally put into reminders.
 Even Siri does not really parse that word well.
 Yeah, but there are some disadvantages and advantages.
 Honestly, I think a lot of stuff is helpful, like being early in building, and the mobile apps as well.
 Maybe, it was just sticking around for plus years.
 A lot of our competitors didnt do that, so that also helps a lot.
 If you want to talk about it, Im curious what Wunderlist was like, competing with them?
 Without knowing a ton of details on their history, they almost seem like the whatwouldhavehappenedotherwise to the different path you could have taken with Todoist.
 It started in Berlin, got wide adoption, it was doing great and then Sequoia came in, led an A, then they ended up getting acquired by Microsoft, and the product died within Microsoft.
 It was a million deal, too.
 I think it was somewhere between million and million.
 One of the reasons that its a great comparison is because from a product perspective, its quite similar.
 Its the most pure play todo list.
 If all you want is a simple list that really, really reliably you put stuff in and it syncs across your devices, Todoist is your best option today and Wunderlist was an amazing option when it was around.
 With all that context, Ill turn back to Davids question.
 What was that like when they came on the scene?
 Initially, I was not really very aware of them.
 Its only after they got a lot of scale that I became aware of them.
 Of course, the problem with the Silicon Valley model is theres no business model.
 They didnt have a business model.
 They gave everything away for free.
 They did have a pro but you didnt really have to pay.
 It was kind of ridiculous, you would really need to be an extreme user to pay.
 For us competing, we need to build a profitable business.
 They dont.
 They basically had almost million or whatever they could just burn.
 Of course, that can generate a lot of growth, but its also maybe not very sustainable.
 Our strategy of surviving them was pretty good.
 Maybe we would have lost if they have kept raising more money, kept pushing the boundaries, and gone for that model.
 I think something to know as well about this productivity space is that retention is really, really brutal.
 Its basically starting a gym, the app version of gym.
 Also competition is also brutal.
 Most VCs today look at the numbers.
 Theyre saying this is very, very bad.
 Its a brutal space as well.
 I think thats also maybe one of the reasons why we havent seen million.
 Maybe we have with Asana and Monday, but thats more of enterprise play and not like this todo app that Wunderlist occupied.
 Its interesting to see that now.
 Was it Christian whos the CEO, I believe?
 Yeah, and now the CEO of Pitch.
 Exactly.
 I was going to say he left Microsoft and started Pitch now.
 I wonder if perhaps specifically taking some of those lessons, Im just projecting but thinking this needs to be collaborative productivity, enterprisewide from the getgo if youre going to raise all that money.
 Yeah.
 Thats maybe also Todoist opportunities, we have solved partially in a good way the singleplayer mode, and were still linked to later on the multiplayer mode.
 Im quite excited about that because in these spaces, singleplayer is the brutal way of building a business.
 You also dont really have this expansion.
 You dont have intranetwork effects.
 LTV is also really low because youre just acquiring one user at a time.
 A lot of the stuff doesnt really make sense.
 Maybe it does make sense if you actually nailed that.
 Then you have a lot of notes that you can basically build at least a virality but also network effects from.
 Every time I tried Asana, since I mostly do these days fully operating singleplayer mode, the singleplayer mode is garbage.
 I wont talk about the multiplayer mode from a product perspective, but certainly singleplayer mode on these enterprisewide systems are terrible.
 If youre able to have both, greatsingle and multiplayer modes.
 Nailing that singleplayer mode is something that nobody else has really done.
 I think we will see some of these new tools.
 Notion is probably a great example of really having a great singleplayer mode and multiplayer mode.
 Creating these tools, the complexity goes way up.
 Theres a reason why Asana arent good at singleplayer.
 Its really hard to be good at both.
 Well Amir, Im curious what are you excited about for the future of Doist?
 Whats the longterm vision?
 Thats a great question.
 Honestly, Im really longterm thinking.
 Im thinking about investing all my life into this.
 Theres no exit in mind.
 I dont want to sell.
 I just want to have a great company that I love to work at.
 Thats one aspect.
 Another aspect is I really feel the way that we work and live is totally broken.
 I really think we need a new stack, and I would love to work on building the new stack.
 Thats something that Im really excited about and Im really challenging the status quo.
 For instance, trying to make asynchronous as default, more widespread than it is.
 I think a lot of the other stuff that we do is knowledge sharing as well.
 If you actually compare how we collaborate and code, how we collaborate on text in general, its really, really broken.
 Why cant we have version documentation?
 Actually in Doist, we use GitHub to manage our handbook.
 GitLab, they also do that.
 It still sucks because it requires you to be a developer to do that.
 The reason we do that is basically its such a powerful aspect.
 You get peer reviews.
 You can see a history of everything, a log of everything.
 You see something like Notion of whatever or the latest, like Coda.
 Its basically the Wild Wild West.
 In a collaborative environment, especially if you have maybe people working on something, you actually want to have a pretty structured handbook, connotation, or knowledge base of your team or your company.
 Theres a lot of stuff that we need to solve and work on.
 I dont think Doist will be alone, but at least I hope we can be on the front lines of this.
 Playbooks are a thing that we do on the main show episodes, but its worth talking here.
 There is this interesting playbook that youve keyed into here that is taking very advanced developer tools and figuring out how to bring that model of working away from just developers.
 David and I struggle with this all the time.
 Notion doesnt even have suggestions right now.
 David will write up an outline and Ill go in to make some comments, but what I really want to do is edit it and then have him approve my changes.
 I cant do that, so I make them orange.
 Google Docs is more advanced than that.
 Thats a workaround that works for us because were two people, but if we were people, no way that would work.
 Even at PSL, Im frequently collaborating with my coworkers and our model is weve bastardized suggestions in order to do the nondeveloper version of a pull request.
 I want to go in.
 I want to make these changes.
 I know Im not the final decision maker on this, someone else is or vice versa.
 Theres not a great nondeveloper workflow for a pull request in Prose effectively.
 Thats totally essential in a remotefirst world where you cant grab someone and go, come look over this over my shoulder for the next three minutes and make sure youre cool with all these changes.
 We need to bring that developer model which has worked for a distributed workforcefrankly because of the open source movementand figure out how to make that work for companies where engineers arent the only people who get tools like that.
 Im just thinking in my mind this whole time were talking about this.
 I have Rahul at the pizza shop with Conrad, convincing him to join and making the pitch to join Superhuman as his cofounder.
 Developers, we have these amazing powerful tools, he is talking about text editors.
 If we bring that to everyone else, how powerful is that?
 This is the same thing.
 Theres a lot of stuff on that front.
 Were just seeing the tip of the iceberg.
 We are paying such a big price as a society to have these bad tools and bad processes.
 Maybe were not really reaching our potential as a species because we are still stuck in Word documents.
 I think thats a great, great place to leave it.
 Amir, if people want to learn more about what youre doing or ever want to reach out to you, wheres the best place?
 It is Twitter.
 Im actively tweeting on amixk.
 You can just follow me, tag me, and I will try to respond.
 You got to give us the story behind your Twitter handle.
 Is it k like mystery sciencetheater where does the k come from?
 Is it like Andre ?
 Its basically like Andre and its also futuristic.
 I probably had some drinks when I created that.
 Fantastic.
 Well put a link in the show notes so some folks can follow you.
 Thats great.
 Thank you so much for joining us.
 Thank you folks and keep up the great work on the podcast.
 Im looking forward to this every time you release something new.
 Appreciate it.
 LPs, well see you next time.
 Actually, well see you in the New Year.
 Thats right.
 may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate andor amusing transcription errors Hello, Acquired LPs.
 David and I are very excited to welcome Brad Slingerland and Jon Bathgate from NZS Capital today.
 Welcome, Brad and Jon.
 Hey, guys.
 Thanks for having us back on.
 Yeah, thanks for having us.
 Maybe before we dive into our conversation, just do some quick intros so background on you a little bit.
 Brad, do I have it right?
 You cofounded NZS with Brinton who was previously on the show with Jon.
 Thats right.
 We started NZS Capital in .
 Great, and you seemed to be the writer of the group.
 You publish a ton of content on top of the white papers that we talked about both on the show and on Twitter.
 Do you do your newsletter once a week?
 Yeah.
 In terms of writing, everybody in the group writes a lot.
 Were sort of a writing organization.
 I think Brinton and I have produced a lot of the white papers over the years going back to years ago and all of those we made public whenever we write something and put it up on the website, and those are all available.
 I spend most of my writing time on the weekly newsletter, which goes out Sunday mornings which is sort of just a rambling look at a lot of things.
 Its called Stuff I Thought About Last Week and thats sort of the accurate description of what goes into it.
 Such a great name.
 I love it.
 For folks who didnt hear our previous episode, what is NZS and how would you describe it?
 NZS Capital, we are a public stock market investor.
 Brinton and I worked together since at our prior firm that was a company I started at in as a summer intern.
 I was there for years.
 Brinton and I subsequently left, formed NZS Capital, and had a couple of our favorite team members, Jon and Joe as well, join us at the beginning of .
 We launched our public market investment strategies at the very end of beginning of and those are targeted mostly at institutional investors.
 Big insurance companies, endowments, pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, and then also for outside of the US investors, we have a fund for retail investors as well.
 Thats great.
 The last thing on your background, I saw you did your undergrad in astrophysics, how did you end up doing this after studying astrophysics?
 Astrophysics is certainly a hobby and something Im not smart enough to proceed professionally, to go to get a Ph.
D.
, or anything like that.
 I do really enjoy it.
 My education was in economics and astrophysics, but I was always mostly passionate about the stock market going all the way back to middle school and started working, interning during college with a large investment firm in Denver.
 What I like about just having two different analytical frameworks to use is youve got this very scientific, rigorous, scientific method to test the hypothesis, try and disprove it, and then just try to marry that with other mental models around the world.
 The benefit it brings to this looking at investing in businesses, but its mostly just a hobby.
 Charlie Munger would be proud of you.
 Jon, switching over to you, were you a math undergrad?
 Yeah.
 I was math.
 I actually went into undergrad, studying economicssimilar mindset as Brad.
 I knew I wanted to go into investing.
 I have just been obsessed with markets since I was in fifth grade.
 Then I got to undergrad and got into econ and honestly just sucked at it.
 I was just terrible.
 I was taking math on the side and just stuck with it, which was fine.
 You were better at math than econ?
 Econ is like easy math.
 Yeah, its kind of counterintuitive, right?
 But I just loved it.
 It was just kind of like second nature to me.
 There were kind business school classes.
 I went to Boston College and theres an undergraduate business school there, and so I did take financial accounting and some basics, but I basically came out of undergrad not really knowing how to analyze a stock and things like that.
 Then when I interviewed at our previous firm in I had to learn on the fly, which honestly, the kind of building spreadsheets and stuff like thats the easy part, the business analysis is the fun part and the hard part.
 That was kind of how I got into the industry.
 Then just kind of a fun fact.
 I started at our previous firm in March of .
 My first day in the industry was the day that Bear Stearns announced that they were going to sell for a share to J.
P.
 Morgan, which was kind of the holy smokes moment of the financial crisis.
 Then Ive only switched jobs once in my career, which was to come over to NZS in early March of the week before the pandemic really took hold.
 I started NZS and like a crazy bear market also.
 Hopefully, I can stay in NZS for a long time because You got to let the whole Acquired community know whenever youre switching careers next because that is when we short, not now.
 Thats how it feels.
 Speaking of, we were talking before the episode, the reason we wanted to do this with you guys is from the first episode we did with NZS, your whole way of using complexity theory to think about investing in companies and markets is fascinating.
 I love it.
 So many of our listeners loved it and we thought because its so different from everything else weve heard.
 Lets talk to you guys about what is going on right now here in late January as markets are different than they were a month ago.
 Let me tee up with what David means by right now.
 Were recording this at AM Pacific on January .
 Right now, the SP year to date is down about .
, probably rebounded a little bit this morning, and the NASDAQ, which everyone knows is more techfocused, down about .
 Quite a start to after a hell of a run in and .
 By the time you hear this, who knows because it seems like every cycle in every part of the business has gotten shorter and shorter, but that is where we are today.
 Brad, maybe lets start with you.
 This is an enormous question so you can choose to answer however youd like, but what is going on and how did we get here?
 I want to go all the way back a million years in time, but we probably couldnt.
 This is Acquired.
 Around the evolution of human psychology.
 Just to not go quite back that far.
 I mean, obviously, we had the pandemic started, were coming up on two years on that.
 There was this initial fear that Jon references, I think everybody probably remembers, it does feel like a lifetime ago.
 Then this just unleashing of incredible coordinated global economic stimulus, both fiscal and monetary in form of low rates here in the US, literally checks being sent to people.
 There is this period of uncertainty in that just exploded into this period of spending in .
 You look at consumer spending over and its like probably more I think is the recent Commerce Department data for the US.
 Thats but versus prepandemic levels, theres just all this money.
 The way were spending it, where weve spent it as consumers has been in different places.
 Instead of going on vacation, weve been fixing up our houses, so its caused all this sort of acute demand for a lot of things and then not demand for these other things.
 The economy just cant turn.
 We are so global.
 Weve been on the sort of year globalization trend where the supply chain is getting more spread out, and in a lot of ways more fragile and you just cant get your hands on things.
 This huge burst in demand last year caused this big pickup in inflation.
 I think one of the latest numbers is or and some of it is transitory, some of it is maybe a little bit structural and we can come back to that.
 Now the governments are saying, okay, well, we gave everybody way too much money.
 We gave way too much stimulus out there in the economy, and were going to reel it back in.
 The main tool they have to do that is to raise interest rates.
 Theyve signaled raising interest ratesdepending on how you want to read the tea leavesmaybe four times.
 When theyre raising interest rates, I think I havent seen, obviously theyve been taking on more and more on their balance sheet every month.
 Theyve been buying hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and I think thats tapering.
 Have they ever announced any plan to start shrinking the balance sheet of the Fed along with these interest rate raises?
 I think that ultimately, the Fed would like to stop the experiment of running a massive balance sheet.
 Suddenly, there are a lot of questions on certainty around how that plays out.
 You end up with this scenario where no rates are going up and then theres this tension in the stock market between people who think this is appropriate, inflation is the root of all evil, its structural, and its here to last and weve got to just kill it.
 The people who think well, actually, the economys quite fragile.
 Were still in a pandemic, people are still sick.
 Theres a lot of things going on.
 If we all of a sudden just hoover all of the money back out as quickly as possible, then thats probably as bad as what the situation was, to begin with.
 The market always wants to find some level of homeostasis.
 One of the things we learned from complex adaptive systems is to really think biologically rather than computationally, which is the way a lot of market participants think.
 If we think about homeostasis, here in our body, were trying to constantly maintain our temperature right around .
 degrees, were trying to make sure were not hungry, and then we get enough sleep at night.
 All these things that our bodies regulate often without us knowing.
 The markets also trying to do this.
 Its trying to come to a consensus on what do we think interest rates are going to be a year from now, years from now, or years from now?
 What do we think inflation is going to be?
 What do we think profit margins are going to be?
 What do we think is going to happen in emerging market growth versus developed market growth?
 Most of the time, you can never reach equilibrium or homeostasis in a complex adaptive system.
 You can in a biological closed system like a human body, but most of the time, its constantly being perturbed.
 This idea of disequilibrium is the equilibrium is a concept from Brian Arthur, who sort of wrote a lot of the great texts, complexity economics, and wrote the original paper on compounding and network effects.
 Increasing returns, right?
 Sorry, increasing returns not network effects.
 The market, in particular right now, is struggling to find this homeostasis point, these extreme bouts of volatility up and down.
 The one thing the market needs to come to some sort of agreement on is what is the discount rate?
 What are interest rates?
 What should people use as their hurdle rate for the next years?
 Right now, there are two camps that are disagreeing on it.
 I think this creates tension, this sort of bouncing back and forth between these two equilibriums in the market.
 That started in March of actually.
 It was the first time rates started to go up, growth stock started to come down.
 You can just see this sort of anticorrelation over the last months now of rates going up, growth stocks coming down, and then were in this extreme phase right now.
 Its interesting if you look back, Ive been through a few rate hike cycles in the market over the last years now, I guess.
 There does tend to be this initial difficulty in finding an equilibrium fear over high growth, high multiple stocks, stocks that may not have current earnings, but people are banking on earnings in the future.
 Then what happens is people tend to gravitate back towards the growth assets because they are the assets that are going to create the most value long term.
 Were in this initial period of finding equilibrium or something as close to equilibrium as we can get, and then I would expect this to be no different from prior cycles where unless theres something structural that were not aware of yet, people would be gravitating back towards growth assets.
 As another way to put thatjust to make sure Im understanding itfor these companies without earnings but have high growth that got tremendous multiple expansion by public market investors over the last several years, that was the first place where investors got scared and were selling and created all this downward compression on the multiples so these prices dropped like crazy if this high growth, currently unprofitable, or currently not cash generating tech companies.
 Those get sort of whacked the hardest first, but youre saying ultimately if thats where the growth is in terms of the companies that will become large and profitable in the future, then thats a place also where theres flight back there after the exhale of, okay, were safe.
 Yeah, that tends to be what happens.
 One of the things we learned from complex adaptive systems is we cant predict the future.
 Im always sort of on thin ice when I say this happened in the past and so it might happen in the future.
 I dont see any particular reason why at the right equilibrium point, these growth assets arent, again, more attractive.
 Everybody should have their own sort of way of managing a portfolio of investments, whether its in public markets, real estate, or whatever you do.
 What we do is we balance two types of investments we call resilience and optionality and were able to shift back and forth.
 In times of volatility like today, we like to say, and Im quoting Brinton here but we dont see volatility as risk, we view it as an opportunity.
 Come back to whatever the basics of your own investment strategy are, its a very personal thing for everybody and say, what are the two different types of businesses that I own and where should I be shifting the portfolio today?
 For us that would be, as the market is volatile, moving out are more resilient growth businesses into our more optional growth businesses.
 Maybe just to add a few quick points to that.
 One thing I was thinking about is Brinton and I came on and recorded with you guys I think in midSeptember, and even then you guys asked us pointblank every asset class is historically expensive at this point, obviously, just because of the accommodative monetary policy that weve been in for months at that point.
 I guess thats about a month and a half before the market really peaked.
 Optionality was very, very expensive at that point.
 I kind of ran some math and went back and looked in the NASDAQ.
 The NASDAQ peaked in early November, I think November and it had compounded at annualized for three years going from November to November which is like years of normal compounding, especially in an index rate.
 The chronology from there, there was a big CPI reading, I think November th, which kind of surprised people.
 Its kind of one of the first big inflation surprises to the upside.
 Thats when you really saw the more, I dont want to call them speculative, but definitely higher priced growth assets.
 Then also, crypto coincided with this also peaking at that point partly because just mathematically, if youre discounting back a company where do you think theyre going to start generating cash flow in at a higher discount rate, just the impact on the value of the asset is very different than if youre discounting a company, its going to generate a lot of cash between now and the end of the decade.
 I think whats really thrown people off with the way the market has acted is actually the NASDAQ was relatively strong through the end of last year, but under the covers, there was all this carnage from growth stocks really getting taken to the woodshed, and theres a lot of stats on this.
 The latest I could find was as of January of the stocks in the NASDAQ were down more than which is like a fullon crash, right?
 I mean, thats not too far in the realm of the dotcom bust.
 In some ways, this is like a hidden crash.
 At that point, the index was only and so it was propping up the index.
 Companies with the megacaps like Apple, Microsoft, and Google that were holding in relatively well.
 In the world of network effects and these platforms just getting bigger and bigger, the large platforms make up a larger percentage of the index, so you can have this weird disconnect where actually people look at the NASDAQ, and theyre like even at this point when the NASDAQ is down from the peak in November, that doesnt feel nearly as bad as when you look at stocks that are down to in a handful of months.
 The reaction has been pretty severe, and so I think thats why some people are scratching their heads kind of saying to your broader question, Ben, what is going on here?
 Im curious, I would love your take onthere are two things that are going on now that dont quite make sense to me and Id love your thoughts on that, maybe you particularly, Jon, because I think they both relate to semis in a lot of ways.
 One that I think is more broadly is theres this assumption that seems to be baked inBen, you said it I think without thinking about it a minute agothat the situation with growth tech stocks feels like it was back in the bubble crash era.
 You said these companies are unprofitable, not generating cash flow.
 Thats just simply not true for many of these companies.
 They are profitable, they are generating strong cash flow.
 I look at Zoom, Zoom is like a cash flow monster.
 Look at Coinbase.
 Coinbase is trading at X the last months free cash flow, thats insane.
 Thats a cigar buttstock in Ben Graham terms.
 Obviously, theres the Rivians and stuff of the world where yeah, theres no cash flow in sight, but there are plenty of these companies that are lumped into growth that also are producing cash flow.
 What do you guys think about that?
 Its actually funny that we were talking about this.
 This is like the first big downturn especially in NASDAQ and in tech that I can remember where semis havent led the market down.
 Usually, when volatility is elevated and people are uncertain about the economy, semis are one of the first asset classes to get sold, and theyve actually held in relatively well, and we talked about this a little bit when Brinton and I were on but there were amazing companies in the semiconductor land trading at times earnings or even lower than market multiples last year.
 I do think you have to separate those from more optionality where companies are further out on the profitability or further from being profitable, I would say.
 I do think theres also a little bit like a baby with the bathwater dynamic, just when growth starts selling off, maybe some investors are discerning whats hyper profitable or whats not in growth software land.
 I think this just spawned a general rotation in the market where investors are saying if interest rates are going up, I dont want to own growth software at all.
 I want to own energy, I want to own financials, and be exposed to interestratesensitive asset classes.
 I think thats part of the reason the turmoil is also felt disorienting is the SP is only down also because some of these other pockets of the economy and of the market are working relatively well.
 I should just say just the precursor for all this or the disclaimer for Brad and I is were not like market technicians and not macro experts.
 This is just what we see daytoday, and we do send out a lot of data points just because this is a really unique time for the market.
 We spend of our time analyzing stocks and businesses, kind of a similar approach that you guys take.
 But we do, obviously, live this stuff every day, and so its interesting that every market cycle is a little different.
 Its certainly a complex adaptive system.
 Thats perfect tee up for my second question of something thats not adding up for me right now isI think this is particularly evident in semisif it truly is inflation fears and remodeling discount rates that are whacking growth stocks and so much of what we look at right now, another assumption baked into that is that these companies arent going to raise prices as much as inflation, and yet weve seen with TSMC, obviously semiconductors, but I think plenty of tech companies like Zoom, Tesla.
 Tesla could raise prices by They have been raising prices on all their models and it wont affect demand a bit.
 Theres a lot of pricing power I think baked into these companies, latent pricing power that they havent exploited yet.
 Do you guys think about that when youre looking at companies?
 Having pricing power is a sign of relatively healthy industry dynamics, I would say.
 Semis are a great example because in years past or decades past, they basically had to just sell whatever they could sell at whatever price the market was willing to take at that point.
 Now with the industry being consolidated, I think that the industry overall is providing more value, they have plenty of ability to pass on price.
 We dont want to own companies that are obscuring their customers on price, but if their input costs are going up, weve seen that over the last two cycles actually, they can raise the price.
 I think what you have to be the offset a little bit, just keep in mind is at some point, the price of the consumer is increasing and you do have some element of demand destruction.
 Its hard to know if the price of an iPhone goes from to or do people trade down?
 Maybe they buy last years model or they buy less memory.
 I do think there is some state of end demand destruction whenever you have increases in input costs, but its a good point.
 I think whenever the industry is relatively healthy, then you should be able to pass on price increases, and thats something that we would look for.
 Pricing is interesting, just to add maybe some examples to it because it can cut both ways.
 To take two examples for the last couple of years.
 Two companies whose businesses got stronger as a result of the pandemic would be Amazon and Netflix.
 Although it turns out, were still on about the same trajectory for ecommerce as we would have been had there not been a pandemic, which is a little bit counterintuitive, but its one of those things which went up and actually came back down.
 Amazons gotten much stronger.
 Im going to get this stat off a little bit, I think they spent more on CapEx in the last couple of years than its been in the prior decade or two decades.
 Jeff wrote that amazing letter at the beginning of the pandemic, right?
 Buckle up I think is what he said.
 Yeah, heres something crazy thats happening, lets take advantage of it.
 They are facing extreme inflation in their supply chain and their own logistics, but I dont believe theyve raised the price on Prime membership.
 As soon as I say that, theyll probably come out and push a price increase through.
 Theyve done increases in the past, but its not terribly steady.
 Heres somebody whos using price as a weapon to basically say, were going to get stronger, were not going to raise prices because that actually puts more pressure on our competition.
 Netflix, on the other hand, is raising prices.
 They tend to do it every couple of years and they just announced a pretty big price increase right as their subscribers were slowing down.
 You might say, well, thats a little bit strange.
 I think youve got to say, well, what is the price of the service relative to its value?
 If the price of Netflix is well below its value to the consumer, I dont know that it is and I would speculate thats their thinking.
 That theyre facing inflationthe scarcity of talent in Hollywood is fairly extreme right now, the rising costs of getting production done.
 And so as the industry from the US studio goes from billion to billion in spending this year on content.
 A big chunk of thats just purely inflation.
 Its not necessarily making a lot more shows.
 Netflix is saying we think our service is worth more, were underpricing itI suspect this is their frameworkand so were going to raise the price.
 This is a different way of thinking about price.
 We think about price and aggregate fromour firm is called NZS, which stands for NonZero Sum, and we want to make sure that if a companys raising price that theyre providing more value than the amount of price that theyve raised.
 If they raise prices by the consumers are getting, hopefully, more than in value or their ecosystem is getting more than in value.
 Thats where pricing can cut both ways in terms of a sign of strength or creating this.
 I might argue both sides of the Netflix price increase, which is theyre creating this big umbrella, which makes all their competition look more attractive, or allows their competition to also raise prices, which is going to make their competition stronger and have more money to spend on content.
 Now Disney can raise prices and HBO Max can raise prices, and they can take that price increase and go pay more to directors, writers, and actors.
 As you think about big tech, where did these companies fall?
 To be more specific, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, where do they fall at this point in their trajectory as a resilience bet or an optionality bet?
 Lets think about the companies that arent quite at that level, but are these high growth, high cash flow, high market cap tech companies that are nearing that realm?
 Where do you guys draw the line on whats resilience and whats optionality?
 Maybe I can start with this.
 Jon can do a couple of these and you can jump out on a couple of other ones.
 Although theyre sort of lumped together, for us, theyre very different situations.
 Microsoft, largely driven by its strength of growing IT wallet share and the enterprise is just a strong network effect business that seems to get stronger as every day that goes by.
 Alphabet is in a similar position in terms of the strength of its business.
 We look at sort of the nonzerosum offering from Microsoft and Alphabet, we think its really high.
 We think their users are getting a lot more value than what theyre charging for those services, even though it might be a little counterintuitive.
 Microsoft products arent exactly cheap, but if you look at what youre spending as an enterprise and what the enterprise is getting for those, I think the value proposition is very high, and of course Google, most of the products are free to consumers.
 I think our biggest angle that we like to look for is this concept of nonzerosum and to what extent is the management team in the business adaptable to whatever crazy changes are going to happen in the world.
 Then I think it gets a little bit different when we branch out, go beyond those two, in terms of these megacaps.
 Facebook, we dont need to rehash what are the potential negatives around social networking, but its not totally clear that theyre creating more value than theyre taking for themselves, so thats one.
 Its a stock we havent owned in a long time.
 We look at these individually.
 Jon, I dont know if you want to touch on Apple or any of the other ones in that.
 Yeah, I would just generally say, most companies, especially when you get over the .
 trillion thresholds, I think theyve gotten to the point where they are resilient.
 I guess the two things that we are thinking about, one is do they have powerlaw economics?
 We talked about this when we were on in September.
 Apples obviously the canonical example.
 They have whatever it is unit share of the smartphone market, but theyve got share of the profits in the market.
 I would say at that point, its a resilient business.
 They built the ecosystem around it.
 The argument from five years ago that theyre going to be the next Nokia, Samsung, Blackberry, or whatever it is I think obviously had cold water thrown on it.
 We do think about the range of outcomes.
 Tesla is a different example because theyre approaching a trillion dollars in market cap, or at least they were.
 I would say where Tesla is both in transportation and other businesses in years, the range of outcomes on that is still relatively wide.
 Thats one where that would still be like pure optionality for us and then another one, just that one you didnt ask about, but I think is interesting.
 Its something like Nvidia where we actually owned it as a resilient position for a long time.
 Last fall, just with the stretch in valuations, were seeing a lot of growth in tech, and Nvidia was a candidate for this when it got to a billion market cap.
 Basically, we were playing to get to a trilliondollar market cap.
 I think they have billion in sales.
 I think if they get to to billion in sales, maybe they deserve to be a trilliondollar company, but it just seems like theyre pulling in that trilliondollar threshold by five years.
 Thats when we actually moved it over to optionality.
 Yeah.
 It seems like at that point you could say the business has resilience in it, but where the price is, your investment doesnt feel resilient anymore.
 Exactly.
 I think for a resilient position we need both.
 We need valuation to be relatively resilient.
 We need the business to be resilient and have an ecosystem.
 Thats a rare example where we actually took something down for resilience to optionality based on valuation levels alone.
 One of the things wed like to think about on valuation is that valuation is telling you what the prediction is and whether it has to be right.
 A very highly valued business is telling you the prediction has to be this and it has to be right.
 Oftentimes, its like a parlay bet.
 Its like you have to get this, this, this, and this.
 All have to happen in sequence in order for this valuation to work.
 We view that more as purely gambling and we try to avoid those.
 Its a very low margin of safety in the kind of Yeah.
 We have this white paper called Redefining Margin of Safety thats out there on our website.
 Sometimes I dont have to be right about anything.
 I only have to be right about this very safe thing.
 One of the safest predictions we have at our firm is that electronics are going to push deeper into the world.
 Its like the most basic thing I think I could hopefully get everybody to agree with that Jon talks about all the time.
 If you believe that to be true, then you look at the valuation of some of these companies that are enabling that.
 Youre not being forced to say this company is going to win this whole market, the market has to grow, and I have to get all the timing right.
 Were always looking for things where the valuation is not forcing us to make these very precise predictions about the future, which we know were going to have a very low hit rate on.
 Yeah.
 Fascinating.
 Its interesting thinking about how somethingbecause it gets so overbought, can become an optionality positioneven if you bought it originally because it was resilient.
 Yeah, I think those are relatively rare for us.
 Sometimes we would just sell the position and be fine.
 We would revisit that down the road.
 But Nvidia is a really special company that we feel like we want to own for years.
 Theres still a ton of optionality in the stock.
 I mean, thank God the Metaverse conversation had not started when we recorded in September.
 Whether you layer on Metaverse as to how much its driving, theres a lot of amazing optionality with, I would say, the most creative leader in semiconductors and probably one of the most creative leaders in all of tech at Nvidia.
 At the same time, to Brads point on the predictions, you have to have cloud spending sustained for the next few years and have zero digestion.
 You have to have gaming demand be off the charts, and you have to have zero semiconductor cycles with no inventory issues, which is very possible even at a growth company like Nvidia.
 Thats why I thought that the prediction had gotten pretty narrow so we made a decision to bring it down.
 I think its worth making a point overall on why we have all these trilliondollar companies or these companies that could be trilliondollar companies?
 I think it comes back to a lot of the things we see and learn from complex adaptive systems around power laws, around increasing returns, and around network effects.
 I think one of the things when the market is panicking and trying to find a point of stability, the thing you want to keep in mind is were still very early in this analog to digital transition of the global economy.
 As we see industries go from analog to digital, there are certain characteristics that lend themselves towards these power laws and these network effects.
 Tesla is an interesting example of that, where automotive is one of the most fragmented complicated global industries that I can think of.
 The cars are becoming much more about software and data than about everything else that historically was about and in software data and the way that its distributed and the way its service and part of it is becoming a subscription.
 You could speculate that as that happens, we might see a power law around data network effects or software network effects in cars where we wont have companies around the world all with a small amount of share, or we wont have or companies that dominate.
 There might only be one, two, or three if it were to follow this pattern we have seen in other industries that have gone from analog to digital.
 Thats where this potential comes in for these big businesses.
 Then, of course, the tension that pushes back on that is government and regulatory.
 The governments around the world are really, really not finding their footing in terms of how they want to treat these information age monopolies.
 Theyre using these industrial age playbooks to try and regulate an informationbased business.
 We just have no real view of how thats going to play out, whether theyre going to be successful or take the right strategy on it.
 Could you tell us what are your few big tent theses ideas?
 Brad, like you mentioned, electronics continuing to push deeper into the world feels something that the proverbial all sides of the aisle can probably agree on.
 Do you have others?
 Yeah.
 The most basic one is were going through an analog to digital transition in the economy.
 You can pick a number, but its probably less than in terms of how we transition, whether its in digital payments as part of that.
 We think more payments are going to be done digitally than with cash, checks, or however you want, just the old way of doing it.
 We talked about semiconductors really being the foundation of this, pushing electronics deeper into the world.
 We think some of the most important companies in the world to accomplish that.
 Of course, on top of semiconductors is software and cloud.
 You would think more things are going to go from running onpremises to running in the cloud.
 Connectivity is going to increase more things.
 If it can be connected, it will be connected.
 Thats around the rollout of wireless networks, wireless capacity, spectrum, and everything around the world.
 Then you take those foundational concepts and then you say, okay, well then whats happening in industrial companies?
 How are they leveraging this digitalization?
 Whats happening in healthcare and financials?
 Healthcare and financials are the toughest ones to go digital because theyre so highly regulated.
 Part of thats for good reason and part of it is just bureaucratic.
 We look at healthcare and financials and we say, gosh, we wish we were so much further ahead in the digitalization of these two industries, but the government, the industrial regulatory bodies just keep pushing back.
 That whole complex is just pushing back on progress there.
 In the industrial sector, were seeing a lot of stuff.
 Tesla is a great example of classic analog industrial businesses becoming very, very digital.
 Then we look for what happens when things go digital and get transformed and they tend to become more vertically integrated, data tends to become more important.
 You see these patterns that emerge as a business goes digital.
 Its really just this idea of whats an analog behavior thats becoming digital.
 Chipotle is an example here in the US, the burrito chain.
 Heres a company that was doing well in terms of transitioning to digital ordering before the pandemic but took the pandemic as an opportunity to lean really heavily into digitally transforming their business, all the way to the point where the values in Its a great experience.
 It really is, right?
 I do this multiple times a week.
 Its the same way that Starbucks is now a nearly completely digital experience for me, absent the eight seconds I spend in the store.
 Chipotle has become exactly the same thing.
 Yeah, so these are great examples of companies adapting to digital technology early, which gives them this advantage over everyone else they compete with whos not doing that.
 The bigger and the better they get at doing that, the more it affords them to run their business better and take more share.
 Chipotle is going all the way to installing machine vision cameras with AI and algorithms to monitor whether they need more or less guacamole at different times a day at each store level at each day of the week.
 Maybe wont end up being that useful in terms of avocado waste over time.
 Its something that is this idea of taking, what goes into that?
 A lotimage sensors, semiconductors, software, cloud, then the feedback loop down to the stores, how you communicate that, then how that rolls into your supply chain, and all of that.
 Thats why when the market gets scared about interest rates going up a little bit, we start to get excited because were just so early in some of these really incredible trends.
 Its Buffett tap dancing to work in down markets.
 Whether Chipotle wins, doesnt win, or what have you, whether Chipotle is a position for you guys or not, Im pretty sure TSMC, TI, Sony, and NvidiaChipotle may or may not win or McDonalds may or may not win, but theyre going to do well.
 David, youre teeing up a question that Ive been noodling on ever since our NZS special earlier this year.
 Jon, a question for you.
 I have had a strong, strong desire to just probably not liquidate everything in my portfolio, but take all net new cash and exclusively allocate it to the semiconductor ecosystem.
 So this would be everything from the EDA companies, the chip design software, the fabless actual chip design companies like Nvidias, those types of companies.
 Equipment manufacturers like ASML, foundries like TSMC.
 Im so convinced that in the next years, a lot of the value creation comes from those companies.
 I mean, its going to underpin basically all value creation in the world is going to come from advances in semiconductors and things people build on top of them or an enormous amount of it.
 Where does this fall down in terms of how sure of a thing it is that theyll be able to capture a proportionate share of that value?
 Im excited that you are so excited to invest your personal capital in the semi industry.
 There are a few things.
 One is that there are amazing companies outside of semiconductors.
 Its a big part of our portfolio, but actually, the majority of what we own is nonsemi, even though we talk about semis a lot.
 I guess the scenarios where semis break down for whatever reason over the next years is honestly harder on a year horizon, I would say.
 If we either hit the wall with Moores law or we just literally, despite all the thousands of Ph.
D.
 in physics, material science, and optics, and everyone putting their heads together to solve one of the most important economic drivers in human history.
 If we get to a scenario where we really just have hit the wall, then that will be a problem.
 Obviously, companies that are exposed to leadingedge like TSMC or ASML will suffer.
 One scenario that we actually contemplated a lot more five or six years ago is there was an idea of what are we going to use all these chips for.
 Were talking about sevennanometer and fivenanometer six or seven years ago with ASML.
 It really was not obvious.
 Were like Qualcomm and Apple will design really amazing silicon for smartphones and Intel will make amazing PC chips.
 At some point, PCs kind of got good enough.
 No one really cares about their performance on their PC anymore.
 You care about battery life, the display honestly, the form factor, and other things.
 Or maybe if its a gaming rig, you care about performance a little more.
 Now I feel like with the data center, with everything being connected, with Chipotle putting machine vision in their stores, or like John Deere putting machine vision on tractors for precision agriculture, it just seems like a nobrainer that the secular trend is there.
 There is just push and pull in the near term.
 Were coming off of an incredibly strong recovery out of the COVID downturn.
 This parallels a little bit with the recovery from the GFC.
 When you have times of shortages, generally, customers of semiconductors will eventually overorder.
 Its like the way people buy toilet paper in shortages.
 Its like a psychological thing.
 No matter how sophisticated people are, they will always buy more than they need.
 Theres definitely some risk in the next months that we have some inventory correction because things have been running really hot.
 Were building a lot of fabs.
 Customers cant get their hands on certain components.
 I do feel like people that are focused on the month potential for correction are missing the forest for the trees, especially given the business models and semiconductors are so amazing that these companies arent going to lose money.
 Even if we have a substantial downturn, no ones going to lose money at the top of the food chain.
 Theyll just buy back stock and theyll get through it.
 The amazing thing about semiconductors is the world needs them.
 Youre not going to have a fiveyear downturn in semis.
 You could have a sevenquarter downturn which would tie the longest downturn in the history of the industry.
 Its not like material, its not like copper pricing or oil and gas where you just have no idea when its going to recover.
 Theres a trend line demand for semis.
 That trend line is probably going up.
 So thats the way I would think about it.
 I do appreciate your point, especially the way the industry is consolidated.
 Semiconductors, we think, are as wellpositioned as any part of the economy to capture a lot of value as the economy goes digital.
 Just to underscore so I dont sound like a raving lunatic.
 Theres the obvious stuff thats going to benefit from semis like the next smartphone generation.
 Every tech trend people talk about is predicated on semiconductor advances.
 People talk about autonomous driving.
 Thats really semiconductor development and machine learning development on top of it.
 Machine learning development is semis getting better so that it can process data in this way.
 All of crypto, the whole Metaverse, thats just a whole bunch of really sophisticated and specialized chips.
 Then the incredible amount of software that needs to be built on top, and of course, all the new stuff with vision.
 By the way, all this new stuff with vision and screens for the Metaverse as it arrives, also going to be semis.
 Brad, your point about Chipotle, all these edge devices that are monitoring the guacamole and making sure that we officially create the amount of guacamole that we consume out here in consumer land are also semis.
 Youd never have too much guacamole.
 Its just probably larger nanometer versions of them.
 Everything I can think about that is big waves of net new value creation in the world does seem to be built on top of that.
 Youre obviously preaching the choir.
 I think just like what youre seeing in the market right now is just this push and pull of having the secular trend has really actually gotten better postCOVID just with the acceleration of digitization of the economy.
 Also, just with shortages and everyone is realizing that you cant build anything without semiconductors.
 Its so critical to the automotive industry, to industrials, to the cloud guys, and to smartphone companies, obviously, down the chain.
 I think the cuteness that youre seeing in the market is people are like, I love the year, but Im worried about the months.
 I think that creates a lot of opportunity for individual investors or for people with a longer time horizon because there are a lot of amazing companies, especially building blocks of the digital economy and building blocks of semiconductors.
 Theyre trading at times earnings in a market where growth investing is still relatively expensive.
 To me, that just seems like a mismatch.
 We could be very wrong over months or three years, but we never know.
 It certainly just seems like the industry is well set up to capture a significant amount of value.
 I keep harping on this point but I think the business models in semiconductors are still not appreciated that if you go from EDA software from Cadence and Synopsys to semiconductor capital equipment like Lamb Research, KLA Corp, ASML, to TSMC, obviously, is one of the best business models in the world.
 Analog companies like Texas Instruments, all these companies are phenomenally profitable and profitable through the cycle.
 Now I just feel like your grandfathers semiconductor industry where there were these crazy boom bus and companies were losing money at the bottom of the cycle and had to raise capital and things like that.
 I mean, outside of memory, which is different because its still a pure commodity, everywhere else, youre just going to see companies making a lot of money for a long time.
 Maybe its one year theyre down and have operating margins instead of operating margins, but the trend is definitely in our favor.
 I think its interesting to get some historical perspective, and we think about these engines of growth for the economy.
 Its always good when markets are volatile to try and broaden out and get as much perspective as you can.
 We think about going back to the last few hundred years of capitalism.
 Weve had these engines of economic growth and productivity increases, whether its the early industrial automation, coal, railroads, the creation in the modern banking system, and oil.
 Then we move into the th century and they have the semiconductors, and then the information age I think gets going in earnest around years ago as the PC became this more practical tool that could have a lot more users, and then we went to smartphones.
 So we just step back and we look at this technology as this engine of economic growth and productivity.
 Obviously, we think semiconductors and software are at the base of that.
 This fear in the market right now around inflation is legitimate.
 Some of these factors are going to possibly be structural, most are transitory around this excess capital.
 We talked about being put into the system, but the thing that is always deflationary over the last years of modern capitalism has been technology.
 That whole list that I just went through is all different forms of technology.
 We know the best cure for inflation, to the extent, it is structural if theres a structural labor shortage or something else that happens.
 Theres structural food inflation because of drought, because of global warming, whatever it is thats coming at us, we know the way humans will solve it because were super innovative as a species.
 Thats why were still here is through technology.
 Thats what were always looking for is what are these engines of growth?
 And in this case, I think really engines of productivity and engines of deflationary pressure over time.
 Can you actually speak a little more about deflationary aspects of technology in tech companies?
 Ive heard a lot of people talking about this.
 I think I know what it means, but Id love to hear your perspective.
 How do you define a technology company as being deflationary and what it does?
 If you think about just constantly getting more for less, what does your phone do today that it didnt do a year ago or years ago?
 Ten years ago or a little over years ago, we didnt have smartphones.
 We had dumb phones that we could just text or maybe do rudimentary email on.
 You just think about this, what was doing that function before?
 In some cases, its a new function and this is something we couldnt do before that we can do now.
 In some cases, its displacing something that was done usually in a less automated, more manual, more expensive way.
 I think this is basic coming back to Moores Law, but to use it not just as the technical semiconductor way, but as the broader sort of looser analogy to the economy overall is being able to get more for less as time progresses.
 You see this technology as this really deflationary but certainly disinflationary or this antiinflationary force pushing back on where we might otherwise have these pockets of inflation.
 We look at energy right now, which has been actually a good segment of the market as the high growth stocks have pulled back.
 Weve had these energy shortages and as a global society, mismanaging the transition to green energy by not investing enough in fossil fuels to smooth that over.
 Youve got energy prices are up a lot and we think about it because we have this inflation from energy.
 How are we going to solve that?
 We can solve it technologically by maybe finding fossil fuels more cheaply or the preferred method would be to go green energy globally, and who knows how long thatll take?
 But lets say its years into the future, were probably largely transitioning to a completely green energy economy.
 Weve got storage for that energy as well to handle the fluctuations that we get from sources of green energy.
 This is an example of what I think will be a very deflationary trend.
 Energy is a large input cost in the economy.
 Over time, were essentially not going to free energy, but were going to this much more efficient, cheaper, and more renewable form of energy.
 Thats really deflationary over time to a big input and into pricing.
 You also have labor automation as a big tailwind.
 The huge examples, obviously, are bank tellers, travel agents, and these categories of employment just dont exist anymore because theyve been digitized.
 In the past, honestly, theres been so much focus on automation over the last years.
 It felt a little bit low NZS.
 I dont think its great to just be trying to get rid of people like for Uber to get rid of the guy in the front seat because you want to automate his job out of the process just to boost your profitability.
 Now that were in a situation where we have pretty severe labor shortages in the US, this becomes the obvious solution and I think it is a higher NZS solution.
 Automated ordering at McDonalds using AI is a good example.
 But even we were reviewing a software company yesterday and the software platform costs a year for SMBs and smaller enterprises.
 It can allow them to eliminate, eventually, one or two CPAs and the FPA department that probably cost the company a year.
 I just feel like there are so many examples, whether its software automation where you can remove a little bit of the burden that labor imposes on companies, and thats a huge driver of deflation also.
 It seems like its kind of that fundamental definition of technology where technology enables a person to be more productive so you can get more value out of less labor.
 Of course, that has all sorts of negative implications if that transition happens too fast, if it happens on a micro basis where you automate yourself out of a job, or anything like that.
 But if the definition of inflation is that it costs more to get the same value, then technology seems deflationary to allow you to get more value for less input cost.
 Is all technology investing deflationary?
 I want to say yes, but I dont want to say that because as soon as were done talking, Ill think of examples where thats not true.
 I think thats right.
 When we think about structurally, Im sort of like a nut on demographics and so Im always looking at how wrong the global population models are.
 If you take actual current fertility and birth rates, you look at the movement of people around the world, which is slowing down.
 Theres a lot less immigration from developing markets to developed countries.
 You look at it and you look actually very close to seeing developed market population in aggregate certainly not growing anymore and in a lot of cases declining.
 But we still want the economy to grow because we know that capitalism and economic growth is the best way to lift everybody up.
 This whole can of worms around how thats also creating a lot of inequalities.
 Im not saying that thats okay.
 Im just saying we know that the bottom goes up and the top is going up even faster, but everybodys lifting up faster.
 We want to keep growth going because we dont want to have too much growth or hypergrowth, but we want to have some amount of growth.
 If youre not doing it through the growth in the number of people who are consuming, the growth in population to reduce the human down to a unit of consumption in the economy, then youve got to do it through other ways, so productivity gains are a great way to do that.
 You can even see, right now were in this labor shortage, which we think is actually fairly structural.
 It was probably accentuated by the pandemic but had started before the pandemic.
 It has a lot to do with immigration and birth rates.
 Birth rates being down years ago, which is not something we can go back and fix without a time machine.
 Immigration being down starting around four years ago, certainly for the US, also true for some other developed markets.
 Now we have to solve this with technology.
 Were sort of faced with we would like to, but now we actually have to if we want to keep that engine of productivity and that engine of growth going.
 I think, technology, we dont have humanoid robots yet.
 Itd be a long time before we have that sort of concept out of scifi.
 Ultimately, in the long run, this feels like a good thing.
 Again, Ben, to your point, there are negative consequences when these things move too fast.
 Lots of people have better alternatives than taking laborintensive jobs at Chipotle that they would rather do instead.
 It feels like a good thing, right?
 Yeah, I dont want to generalize because I know a lot of people also did lose a job that they cant get back because of the pandemic.
 Each individuals scenario is different, but I do think in aggregate, thats right.
 What is it?
 What do we think about?
 Well, or years from now, maybe it means working three or four days a week as a full time job because we have these enhancements or productivity offsets.
 There are a lot of different ways it can play out.
 But this is sort of an interesting one because I think population growth and labor availability is a really important input into the overall economy for everything we look at.
 Let me switch gears for this segment of the conversation.
 Im curious, given the volatility and corrections going on in the last month.
 What is hard about your work right now?
 What are the really difficult decisions and difficult things to carry out, and what are the easy things?
 Whats hard is, honestly, just the outcomes are unknowable in terms of how long this correction can last.
 Is this a year?
 Is it six weeks?
 Theres really no way you can go back and say, oh, well, the correction in the NASDAQ in Q of ib the last taper tantrum was only one quarter, so we should be off to the races in six weeks.
 That, I would say, is the most difficult.
 I think the easiest thing for us to do is just to focus on the companies and our research.
 Just think about companies you want to own for years, we have a reasonable starting point.
 I think the benefit that we have from having worked together for a long time and having executed this playbook is it is kind of like a muscle memory for us that we had a lot.
 Originally, it was in the portfolio at the end of last year, I think, intentionally set up for this kind of scenario.
 The muscle memory of selling is resilient positions, even though theyre businesses we love and theyre down, at least to some extent with the market.
 To add back to optionality, I think that is just like a team muscle memory thing weve built that has been relatively easy.
 Who knows?
 We also might be wrong.
 We could be wrong just to qualify that statement.
 This sounds obvious but absent selling your resilient positions.
 You couldnt add to optionality positions unless you had net new capital coming in in a big way where you could just keep your resilient positions the same and allocate to optionality.
 But still, effectively, that would be selling because youre changing the balance sheet portfolio.
 Yeah.
 Were long only so we dont have shorts on.
 We cant just go to cash.
 We do have to say, were fully invested in.
 The way we execute our playbook is by beefing up resilience when optionality is very, very expensive, and then we harvest that when the opportunities and optionality land presents themselves.
 It is, I think, these psychological factors that are the hardest to overcome for all investors and, I think, for everyone making business decisions as well.
 A couple of things that we say.
 One is were never as smart as we look when stocks are going up, and were never as dumb as we feel when stocks are going down.
 Another way to think about that is when stocks are going up, you want to have humility, and when stocks are going down, you want to have confidence in your process.
 Yet another way of saying the same thing is that you want to have some skepticism when things are going well and some real optimism when things are going badly.
 Thats what I think is this tension a lot of investors and decisionmakers have.
 Theyre looking at the stock market.
 Theyre reading the headlines.
 Were just bombarded with how bad things could be or are.
 But we know thats not how it works.
 We know over time that the optimists are always right, the cynics are always wrong.
 That can be flipped over the short term, but its always true in the long term.
 It comes back to, I think, really just the ingenuity, innovation of humans, and knowing that well solve these problems.
 Its sort of watching as bad as things are and going like this makes me optimistic.
 Thats a really hard thing to get your brain to hold on to.
 I think you said it a minute ago, so much of this comes back to your time horizon.
 I cant remember if we talked about it, Jon, on the last episode about time horizon.
 But whether we did or didnt, Ill ask it here.
 How do you guys think about time horizon in the portfolio, and I guess maybe even a level up above that for NZS as a firm itself and you guys as its principals?
 I guess Ill start on the portfolio part and Brad can maybe talk about the millennium that we want NZS to last for.
 But on the portfolio, its interesting.
 Its actually in our turnover numbers.
 Our turnover in the resilient part of the portfolio is so implied in that is we basically own stocks for years, give or take.
 I think our time horizon there is infinite.
 We basically buy businesses we think we want to own for our entire investment careers.
 Then in optionality, the turnover is .
 Were not really playing for a twoyear time horizon there.
 Were just wrong a lot more, so we do sell stocks more quickly, and we try to fail fast versus just hold on to something and have it drag us down.
 I would say we generally have a little bit of a shorter time horizon in optionality lands because we have stocks on a shorter leash.
 Theres just a wider range of outcomes and we are wrong more.
 But I would say, everything we buy, we want to own for at least the next years.
 Things are more likely to play out that way in resilience, but the asymmetry is much higher if we are right in optionality.
 Yeah, and theres this fractal degree to resilience and optionality.
 We build the portfolio as resilient optionality.
 We want to invest in companies that we think have a resilient and optional element to them.
 We want to run NZS capital, having both resilient elements and optionality elements.
 We know this works best from all of the examples.
 The most enduring systems and biological ecosystems are those that are able to balance this concept of resilience and optionality, which you guys talked about on the last podcast with us.
 When Brent and I started NZS, we said, how do we build a resilient business, but also maintain optionality for the long term?
 How do we attract great talent who want to come work for us?
 How do we attract great investors who want to trust us with their capital?
 We tried to structure our business so that from the startif it turns out three months after we started our fund we went into a global pandemic coincidentallywe would still be here.
 That can mean a lot of different things to a lot of different businesses.
 It can mean keeping a certain number of years of operating expenses on your balance sheet.
 It can mean partnering with somebody who will be there if you need something to get you through a difficult period.
 It can be structuring your product, which in our case, is an investment portfolio in such a way that it is also resilient or acts potentially more resilient than the market, yet still maintains the upside that were looking for as investors, and we know our clients are looking for it.
 We think its a universal framework that applies to a lot of things, but in particular, the way businesses and investment portfolios are structured.
 Im curious, actually, you mentioned some of them and maybe that is the full answer.
 But Im curious, what were the things in setting up NZS that you specifically did to try and maximize to be resilient?
 Im sure you guys have had long careers before NZS in the investment ecosystem and seeing plenty of firms blow up spectacularly or otherwise.
 Im curious how you thought about that.
 Actually, Ill give an answer, then Ill be interested in Johns answer because he and Joe took a risk, as did some other folks, to come over and work for us.
 I think where it starts is just the people.
 If you have people who can work together, trust each other, are also longterm focused and talented, and also internalize the concept of resilience and optionality, that culture is going to get you, hopefully, very far.
 Thats sort of on the more and maybe intangible side.
 More tangibly, we made sure the business was wellcapitalized.
 We made sure that the product was structured in a way that we were comfortable with and that we had experience running.
 We sought an outside distribution partner to help us.
 What we know is were good at a few things and then who knows if were good at anything else?
 The things we dont know if were good at, Brent and I, weve never run a company, so we dont just assume that were going to be good at that.
 We hired a great president, who we worked with in the past for a long period of time.
 We have new people we brought on in operations that are really helpful.
 We said, well, we dont know anything about selling, were just investors.
 We dont know anything about sales and marketing.
 We dont particularly want to spend all of our time building that out, so we went and found this partner to do the distribution for us.
 Its just about making sure that things youre good at, which in our case, is investment team culture putting a portfolio together, partnering with our clients, and giving them the attention that they need, make sure that we set it up so that thats where were spending almost of our time.
 Were not distracted by these other things.
 I think thats just really important to build a business.
 No matter what, whether its an investing business or any business.
 Or a podcast business.
 One specific question to that, was the decision not to short and to be long only, was that the major motivation for it being resilient?
 No.
 Shorting stocks is great for people who do that, are good at it, and believe in it, but were optimists.
 If youre shorting stocks, you fundamentally have to take on a pessimistic mentality.
 You have to believe somethings going to fail.
 Things do fail, so thats why thats totally viable.
 But I dont believe you can be both an optimist and a pessimist.
 I know the data bears out over time that optimism is the right side of that coin to be on.
 I dont feel like we can effectively do both well.
 I know there are investors out there who do both of those things well, but its not something I think that we were good at.
 Brinton, myself, Jon, Joe, and our DNAs investors didnt train us to be good at that.
 I think none of the four of us are inherently pessimistic.
 I think were generally optimistic about things.
 To be a little bit blunt, I think the only reason for us to start a fund that was long, short, and youd be shorting stocks would be just to get higher fees and be able to charge clients more money.
 For us, that just seemed like kind of a low NZS way to approach the business.
 Were out to build an amazing business and have everyone, all constituencies do well.
 But were not out to build an empire with crazy fees or anything.
 At least for the way we invest, its the highest NZS way that we can offer something to clients that we think is reasonable.
 I love it.
 Thats a great place to close unless you have other closing thoughts.
 Why dont I just ask you both?
 Where can people find you on the internet?
 You can find me on Twitter jbathgate.
 Then my email is jonnzscapital.
com or you can visit our website, nzscapital.
com.
 Theres a lot of content there.
 And youre at the intersection of two of the most vibrant we have learned through Acquired aspects of communities of Twitter.
 Fintwit and Semiconductor.
 Fintwit and semiconductor Twitter.
 I think you guys actually contributed to that with the TSMC episode.
 There are a lot more new semiconductor fanboys since August of last year, whenever that episode came out.
 It was a lot of fun, actually.
 Ive met some amazing people.
 Its a fun thing about actually doing something like NZS.
 We still follow compliance guidelines, but we do have a little bit more runway to interact through social media with other individual investors, professional investors, engineers at companies that are all talking about semis and other things on Twitter, which is a lot of fun.
 Yeah.
 Jon mentioned the website, nzscapital.
com.
 We keep all of our white papers there and archive of the weekly newsletter, SITALWeek.
 You can sign up for it through the website.
 Im on Twitter with varying degrees of activity here and there, bradsling.
 We love to interact with folks.
 Its a little bit selfish.
 We actually get a lot of value, probably more value than we give out maybe, but we do try and publish everything.
 Were very transparent.
 Were trying to educate folks.
 I think the work that Jon and Briton have done bringing the semiconductor industry more into the front of peoples minds and educating them on that is an example of how we try and run our business, and try and share as much as we can.
 I guess, patently false that you get more value than you put.
 Ive read half of your white papers and every single one Im like, well, thats a brand new paradigm thats changed my thinking.
 You absolutely do not capture more value than you create with content.
 Anyway, Brad, Jon, thank you so much for the time.
 Thanks, guys.
 Thanks for having us.
 It was really fun.
 Its good to talk to you guys.
 Its so awesome.
 David, I suppose with that, thank you to our friends at Tegus.
 Go check them out, tegus.
com, some of the best research in the world.
 All sorts of searchable, shareable, great transcripts.
 You can listen to them.
 We love it.
 Thanks, Tegus.
 Deflationary technology, if ever there was one.
 We will see you next time.
  may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate andor amusing transcription errors Hello, Acquired listeners.
 Welcome back to another awesome conversation here.
 I am so excited about this one today with Avlok Kohli, the CEO of AngelList.
 We were joking just before we hit record.
 Ben was like, you should do the intro on this one because AngelList literally changed your life.
 Thats not an overstatement.
 Just within the past few years, I and my friend, Nat Manning, have raised over million together on the AngelList platform through a combination of funds and SPVs.
 Weve invested in close to companies.
 Weve done so much.
 We are actually investors in AngelList itself.
 This is like a homecoming episode here.
 Im so excited to do this.
 Avlok, welcome to Acquired.
 Great to have you here.
 Thank you.
 Excited to be here.
 The first thing that I wanted to ask you is around this concept of rebirth.
 AngelList is a yearold company.
 If you would have asked me five years ago, I would have told you, yeah, I understand what they do pretty well.
 Thats where startups that want to raise capital can go and find angels and do party rounds.
 I think its for companies to go and find capital.
 Its a list of angels.
 And then, the business has completely transformed.
 My first question to you is, what happened over the last five years?
 And what is AngelList today?
 Its a great question.
 Early AngelList started off as an email list, literally, where a startup could come and meet a bunch of angels, raise investment, and go off and run the company.
 Uber was famously one of the first startups that did just this.
 I hear there was some guy named Jason.
 Yeah.
 Uber actually raised successfully, including many other startups early on.
 For the first couple of years, AngelList was just that, and it continued to scale with just that.
 The theme to think about of early AngelList is it was really looking for productmarket fit, and there was a team that was just focused on finding glimmers of productmarket fit, like where is it?
 There was an issue around adverse selection.
 Basically, if you announce to the world, hey, come here, youll get money, youre going to get everyone in the world thats going to show up.
 You can imagine the quality of the startups starts to decline.
 At that point, there was an inflection point for the company around, how do you innovate out of this?
 What does that actual product look like?
 Thats actually how the original idea for syndicates was born.
 It was like, well, why dont we actually have GPs who can put skin in the game, then bring a syndicate of LPs, and they can actually serve as the quality filter, the signal from the noise?
 That was that original spark of that innovation that turned into syndicates.
 Along the way, the early teamagain, more of like a think tankalso focused on a few other problems that startups used to have.
 Its raising capital, its hiring employees, and its finding customers.
 Of course, syndicates were focused around raising capital.
 The job board, AngelList Talent, was around finding employees and hiring employees.
 Product Hunt, which was acquired a few years later, was around finding customers.
 That takes us to the timeframe of where you had these three different products that by this point, even though they solve for a single customer, so all products were a single customer, they basically branched out into several different product lines and really business lines at the end of the day.
 On realizing that, the first thing that was done was to say, okay, lets experiment with spinning out one of the product lines as its own company because trying to do all three in one place is actually incredibly hard.
 It splits focus, splits the team, and all of that.
 This is right around when you came in as CEO, right?
 Yeah.
 This was actually just a little bit before when I came in as CEO.
 AngelList Talent was actually the first to spin off as its own company.
 Even though it still shared the name AngelList, underneath the hood it was a separate corporate entity with a separate CEO with a separate team.
 That ended up working really well.
 Thats around the time that I came in, which was in mid .
 The goal was to actually take venture, which is the financial platform, spin it out its own company, and then really think about venture as its own business and really rethinking it from the ground up of, if were to build a venture scale business out of it, what does that actually mean, what decisions do we need to change, what do we need to make, and really focus on that.
 The same thing happened to Product Hunt just a couple of years later.
 You can almost think about early AngelList as a think tank, and then it split off from these different business lines.
 When it comes to scaling a company, you really do need a team thats singularly focused on one thing, a board that is singularly focused on one thing.
 You cant have split focus on this.
 The key juncture was actually that splitting off into different companies.
 Some of that, Naval and I talked about before I stepped it, around like, hey, if were really going to make this thing huge like large business, what are the things that would need to be true, and how would we get there?
 Some context on me.
 Ive started three companies, one of them was bought by Square.
 For me, the only thing I really wanted to do was build something large.
 We really focused the entire conversation and discussion around, great, theres something thats obviously valuable in the venture business, and how do you take it?
 How do you build it into this large platform?
 Now that Wellfound is the new name for AngelList Talent, the only thing that retains that original AngelList think tank name is AngelList Venture, correct?
 Thats correct.
 AngelList Venture is now AngelList.
 Our purpose is to increase the rate of innovation in the world, so weve really embedded it.
 We want to dive into a lot with you.
 I want to learn too on how this transformation happened.
 I know a little bit of it, but I just want to underscore and go back to something, like you said, a few minutes ago.
 The transformation and the brand perceptionI know thats not exactly how you put itof AngelList in period before you took over in the transformation, if you had told me back thenI was a professional venture capitalist at large firms that went and made a decision to start a new fundI would never start that on AngelList.
 If you had told me that fast forward five years, and I would be running funds, managing capital on AngelList, and an investor in AngelList itself, I would have said, you are completely crazy.
 That is for theres the adverse selection problem, theres low quality stuff on there.
 I would never want to be associated with that.
 Today, its completely the opposite, and Im in on the platform.
 This is an amazing transformation.
 I think the key reason for that early reception is because early AngelList did look like a toy.
 The SPV product, when you just think about that product itself, its such a simple product, and it looks like a toy.
 If you are a professional VC, youre not really going to be using an SPV product.
 Youre actually going to want to use a fund product.
 Not only that, but a very complex fund.
 Avlok, maybe for folks in our audience who arent investors or venture capitalists, why would SPVs look like a toy?
 What was it about them that felt overly simplistic?
 The way to think about a venture fund or a venture SPV is there is an agreement that governs all of it, which is called the limited partnership agreement.
 Its an LPA, thats the acronym.
 When you have an SPV, the LPA that governs an SPV is effectively a set of parameters.
 The number of parameters that you need to consider for an SPV LPA is, just to make a simple example, lets call it five parameters.
 Pretty simple.
 Now, as you get into a fund, and you get into a larger fund, you can think of the number of parameters that you need to set up.
 It could be it could be .
 It really depends.
 It gets very nuanced very, very quickly.
 SPVs are simple.
 They look like a toy because theres just not that many parameters around it.
 A fund gets more and more complex because there are just many more parameters.
 The reason these products look like a toy and the reason AngelList only focused on SPVs in the very beginning, is because our entire approach to fund management has been distinctly different from anyone else doing this.
 We truly are an endofone company, I have not found anyone else thats done what weve done.
 I think its because we made an irrational decision early on.
 Maybe its because we like doing hard stuff, or maybe we just didnt know what we didnt know.
 Ive heard of many founders, CEOs whove built successful companies, if I knew then what I know now, I never would have done it.
 Honestly, I feel like that sometimes, where Im like, yeah, I dont know if we would have done it back then, but we did it.
 What we did differently from everyone else is we built software, and we took everything on about running a fund in an SPV.
 Okay, lets talk about software.
 What I mean by that is, we actually took the LPA.
 We wrote code to model the LPA in code, in a database, that then would output financial reporting, tax reporting, portfolio management, and all of it.
 We built code around, and we did all of it like many aspects of managing the lifecycle of an SPV and a fund.
 When youre writing code to do this, you cant take on more complexity until you build a foundation.
 Early on, what happened was, we had SPVs, they were simple relative to a fund, we took the market on SPVs, and we actually became the market leader.
 I think you really enabled it to.
 They didnt happen in the same way before AngelList.
 Exactly.
 You would need to go hire a lawyer.
 You would need to go hire an accounting firm.
 You would essentially pay a lot of money to do that.
 That actually, definitionally restricts the number of GPs that can use it.
 But when you build software for it, you bring the cost down.
 By definition, you can bring the size of the SPV down, which then enables more GPs to get into business.
 What am I describing?
 Im describing technology innovation at its core.
 This is what technology is.
 It provides more leverage to more people so more people can do it.
 Its interesting.
 Its literally the classic innovation cycle.
 You start with something small, you really compress things that look like a toy, but then of course, you expand, then you expand, and then you expand.
 Of course, what happened was, we started SPVs that looked like a toy.
 But then once we had the foundational software built, then we expanded.
 I think of this as stacking innovation.
 Its actually a concept I pulled from my time at Square, which is, as youre building the layers and you stack the layers, you have higher and higher defensibility.
 You can do more and more complex things because these innovation layers stack.
 They connect like Lego blocks, and then they effectively give you superpowers.
 They give your customers more importantly superpowers.
 SPVs, we laid the foundation.
 Venture funds, we laid the foundation.
 A really cool thing is when Naval and I got to talk about rolling funds, which was a shower idea I had and connected this broader theme of, this is the way funds should be.
 I remember that initial conversation we had.
 Hes like, yeah, I had brought this up in the past, but I dont think we have the infrastructure then.
 Now that we looked at it, were like, well, we have the layer that we built through SPVs, the layer we built through venture funds, and it turned out that those rolling funds, we had it all.
 We had the layers to now support rolling funds, which is an incredibly complex vehicle.
 We had the layers, and we actually went from idea to market in a couple of months because we had all the foundational layers built out, and the innovation just stacked along the way.
 Going back to the earlier observation of the feeling was around, hey, AngelList cant handle this, cant handle more complex funds.
 Honestly, that was valid.
 We couldnt, but that was the point.
 It was by design.
 Did you even have a fund product at that point in time, or was it just the SPVs?
 It was primarily SPVs.
 We started working on funds.
 We were primarily focused on very small funds like half a million dollar funds, million dollar funds.
 If you actually map the fund size by year, youll actually see a very clear increase in total fund size that AngelList is taking on.
 Again, this is the standard march of us just moving up market, moving up market, and moving up market.
 Fast forward to today, were supporting million funds.
 Whereas two years ago, we would actually say no to these funds because were like, look, we cant credibly support your fund for the next years.
 AngelList takes an incredibly long view.
 We also take our commitment to our customers very seriously.
 I feel physical pain when our customers dont have a great experience.
 I really internalize it, and the team internalizes it.
 I highlight too, youre building product and building software, but the product is a lot of money, peoples livelihoods and companys livelihoods, which is also so funny given the brand and AngelLists origins and perception as this toy.
 But a large part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem now is managed by your product.
 David, youve brought endowments on to AngelList by investing in Kindergarten.
 Yeah, plusyearold university endowments, and now LPs of mine and others on AngelList.
 Were pretty private, overall, private in terms of what we share, but we have one of the highest quality endowments as an investor in AngelList as well.
 Again, this is all around, as we become the fabric of venture, were essentially bringing in all of venture, all the large LPs, all the great GPs, all the best companies.
 At this point, were managing across funds and syndicates, portfolio companies.
 These arent just records in a database where its a readonly record, where once we never do anything with it.
 For a good portion of the funds, were the signatory on the funds.
 We review the docs when the followon rounds happen.
 We handle the backandforth of the company when theres a distribution.
 And then we also handle the distribution to the LPs.
 We handle everything including banking.
 We actually have integrated banking thats built in.
 We really do manage it all.
 When it comes to managing the portfolio, it is managing all aspects of that portfolio on behalf of the GPs.
 It really is the product that should have existed in the world but didnt because you just couldnt get the technology leverage back in the day.
 We really have absorbed all of the paper pushing, back office work that GPs dont want to be involved in because, again, a GP has a limited amount of time.
 They should really be focused on finding great founders, investing in great founders, and then helping great founders.
 Thats the real differentiation with GPs, not back office work.
 To grab a playbook theme that we talked about a lot here on Acquired, when you vertically integrate, you have to take on a lot of fixed costs, you have to do a lot of forward investments, but vertical integration almost always leads to a better customer experience.
 By you guys willing to take on all this vertical integration and all this platform years of building, it does enable this fast and fluid experience for GPs, founders, LPs.
 David, correct me if Im wrong, but when you and I invest in a company, and I have to go back and forth with the companys legal team like UCC and AngelList, I think theyre the GP.
 Youre not even technically the GP.
 Its very funny.
 When Ben and I invested in companies together outside of the PSL remit, Ben, youre investing personally, and Im investing out of AngelList.
 Again, I never would have believed this.
 My life is easier than yours.
 Is that right?
 Is AngelList actually the GP of your fund?
 Yes, I dont even sign any documents.
 That is serious vertical integration.
 Yeah, its built on that.
 There are actually two different ways in which we can support a fund.
 One is, think of it as a full vertical integration where AngelList can be the GP if the GP wants that.
 That typically comes in when all the GP wants to do is make the investment, and then AngelList handles literally everything soup to nuts.
 We also support the structure where the GP is the GP, AngelList is still managing the fund, and then there are aspects of it where we could be the signatory, and we would still review the docs.
 Think of it as a dial of control.
 You can have it in full vertical integration where youre like, you know what?
 AngelList, you handle all of it.
 Im just going to focus on investing.
 And then you can dial up the control.
 The GP can say, you know what?
 I actually want more control.
 We now also support that.
 Actually, Im glad you brought that up because that was one of the other things that made it look like a toy earlier on.
 Early on, again, to reduce variability and to reduce the number of parameters so we can actually automate, build software, and build that foundational layer, we, by default, were the GP on everything, GP on SPVs, GP on funds.
 I believe when I in Kindergarten started, that was the only option.
 There was no option not to be the GP, which was fine for us because this is our side investing activity.
 Were not trying to build a fulltime firm here.
 Exactly.
 Again, we actually see also the split.
 There are some people that still are like, I just want AngelList to the GP, and people now just know this.
 LPs know this and theyre comfortable with it.
 Again, this is the interesting about venture, and is one of the things that surprised me actually stepping in as CEO of AngelList is anything thats new or novel actually, originally is viewed as like, uhuh.
 Not going to do it.
 I get it.
 Early on, I was on some calls with LPs where AngelList was a GP and there were a lot of questions around it.
 It was like, why is AngelList a GP?
 Why isnt the GP the GP?
 This was part of the growing pains, if you will, of us building out the full product in the software stack.
 But then, a couple of years ago we built an option.
 Its like, look, you can be the GP now, were ready to do this.
 Of course that then allows for larger and larger funds to come on once where they do want more control, they do want to be the GP, and they want AngelList to manage everything else.
 That, of course, allowed us to continue to move up market, take more and more of the market.
 Did that also unlock existing funds and firms already?
 For me, when I was starting Kindergarten with Nat, we were de novo, we were new.
 Of course, were going to start on AngelList.
 But if you already have three funds under your belt, and you manage million in capital, thats a much tougher decision to then move over to AngelList, right?
 Exactly.
 Another way to frame that is, we were literally creating the market.
 Were creating new GPs, enabling new GPs.
 As we continue to build out the software, the platform, we are now able to take on existing GPs.
 People have already started funds.
 People who do want to be the GP on the fund, people who need a lot more variability, a lot more configuration, a lot more customization.
 Weve already built all of it because again, it goes back to stacking the innovation where once you lay the foundation, you lay the next foundation, lay the next foundation, you actually get compounding benefits.
 There was actually a time, by the way, when AngelList had a waitlist because there were just so many funds trying to get in and we hadnt productized a portion of it.
 We just cant take these on.
 This is literally going to break us.
 Its going to break us.
 I remember, at one point, I was dual heading the CEO role.
 I was also an account manager for funds, launching funds.
 At night, I would go home, and I would get requests.
 Hey, I want to invest in this company.
 Im like, great, let me work on it.
 Im reading peoples LPAs.
 That just to give you a sense of, there was a moment where we were absorbing so much demand, but we were still building out that software.
 But once its there, boom, you get compounding benefits, compounding advantages.
 Were now sitting on years of innovation that are stacked, thats compounded, that for us, we can just simply scale to increasing levels of complexity, scale to increasing levels of quantity, and we dont skip a beat.
 Were just moving forward smoothly managing all of venture.
 It seems like theres got to be huge advantages to your ability to scale, having an engine that translates LPAs into code.
 Can you talk a little bit more about what that actually looks like?
 The way to think about the LPA, its an agreement that binds the GPs and the LPs for the next years.
 The agreement captures everything from who invests what, on what terms, what does the GP get, what does the LP get, what happens in the future around distributions.
 You can think of each of these clauses in an LPA has to be reflected in code for when there are specific events that happen.
 One example of an event is the fund has to raise capital from LPs.
 Great.
 Now an LP is going to wire money in.
 What happens from the second the LP wires money in?
 You need to reconcile it, you need to match it to the LP.
 You need to take it, then you need to put it into the limited partnership vehicle, and then you need to make sure that ownership is captured in the correct way.
 Thats the first part.
 Next, what happens when you start deploying capital into companies?
 You need to capture the entire record of that.
 You just store that.
 Okay, what was invested?
 In what valuation?
 You need to make sure of the share price, the total number of shares is all fully captured.
 These events all need to be managed.
 I share this with the team internally where I say, look, we cant be accurate on things.
 This is a financial instrument.
 If your bank was accurate on your cash thats sitting there Too soon, Avlok.
 Too soon.
 Yeah, thats right.
 Exactly.
 Technically, I think the FDIC posted or .
 Yes.
 If your bank is accurate, or if I make an investment in the company, I wire million in, and theyre like, great, we got .
ish, give or take Id be like, okay, this is accurate.
 This is not accurate.
 Exactly.
 When you think about all of the events that have to be captured precisely and correctly across the entire lifecycle, years.
 Its not, oh, you do it for one year and youre good.
 Nope, years.
 These are obligations.
 Everything is captured across years.
 It has to be reported around financial reporting, around tax reporting, the distributions.
 Having everything captured correctly and accurately for years, ends up being really, really important and can actually only be done with a platform play.
 Its incredibly hard to do it in the way that the rest of the industry does today.
 This has been the other interesting part about running AngelList.
 As were building, its just becoming clearer and clearer that this is the only way that this industry will scale.
 This is the only way that people can actually build and scale venture funds because the other way just has a lot of human error, a lot of data portability issues.
 Most other providers only support one small slice of it.
 Youll have someone that only handles subscription documents.
 Youll have one vendor who only does financial reporting and accounting, another one only does tax reporting, and then another one that only does investor relations.
 Our view has always been, we should be able to do all of it.
 Thats really the ideal product.
 Thats what GPs really, really want.
 In fact, by not doing it, youre actually keeping a lot of GPs out.
 People who could be great investors are not getting in because you know what?
 This is too much back office overhead.
 Totally.
 Nothing gets these firms.
 Theyre great firms.
 You walk into a Sequoia, you walk into an Andreeseen.
 You walk into any venture firm that, in recent years, has been managing large amounts of capital across multiple sectors and stages.
 There are maybe people working there in the back office managing all of this.
 The GPs didnt get into the business to do that.
 Exactly.
 Actually, were managing it very privately, I cant share the name specifically, but I can share the other firm.
 Were managing one of the top VC firms.
 Were managing the entire scout infrastructure, all of it, endtoend, the entire thing.
 It is actually a result of us building this platform that can handle more and more complex funds and volume as well.
 Were handling it endtoend, every single aspect, including compliance, portfolio management, scout management, literally everything.
 By the way, its all run through software.
 Not to preview your customer conversations over the next few years, but thats like a gateway drug too, right?
 Like, oh, manage my scout program.
 Five years from now, Ill be managing the whole firm.
 Exactly.
 This is just a classic move up market continuing to take more and more of it.
 Avlok, I want to keep digging at this LPA to code thing.
 You could imagine, its pretty easy to translate some parameters of LPA to code.
 For example, oh, I dont want .
 I want .
.
 Or, I want .
 at the beginning, .
 at the end, and I want each year to incrementally change between those two things.
 Lets say I get really clever in my LPA, and I say something like, well, I want, of course, an escalating amount of carry depending on how much capital has been returned so far, and also I want a non standard window.
 Lets say I distribute shares of a company after its gone public, I dont want a fiveday look back at the average price of the SP in terms of what I get my credit for.
 I want a day look back.
 My LPAs agreed to it, and it signed a signed document.
 How does wonky stuff get translated to code?
 In a few ways, first is having an infrastructure that is flexible enough, where you can actually stack and add these different types of terms so that it isnt fixated on, okay, you can only do this particular term on look back.
 You can only do this one look back.
 You can actually have the infrastructure itself be flexible.
 Second, there is an aspect of reading the legal documents and then translate it into a mathematical representation of what the clause means.
 Legal agreements are basically code in English.
 Thats what it is if the agreements written in English.
 The job to be done is, how do you translate that English, that clause into some formula that Ben can get represented in software?
 As long as the infrastructure supports that, now the job to be done is, how do you translate that LPA and the clauses of the LPA?
 This is where, as were making big advancements in AI and large language models.
 What is a large language model?
 It is using English, a natural language, as a programming language to query other natural languages like other unstructured data, so you can effectively ask unstructured data to structure itself, and thats where you get back.
 We have a lot of innovation inside the company thats focused just on that.
 We have a huge repository of LPAs, obviously, because were supporting so many of them.
 Weve already, through humans, taken the LPAs and represented them in code today.
 We have this repository that we can then feed in, such that going forward, we can actually have the LLMs prompting as a way to pull the necessary information out in representing code.
 By the way, thats just one small aspect of what it means to build software for a venture fund.
 There are many other aspects as well around managing it for the full lifecycle, as I shared earlier.
 Oh, my God.
 Im just thinking of tax, Ks.
 Everything.
 Oh, my God.
 What a nightmare.
 I dont think if this has been shared publicly before.
 There are a hundred workflows that we execute on, on behalf of all the funds in SPVs.
 These are a hundred workflows that are operational workflows.
 That could be anything from updating portfolio valuations, preparing Ks, responding to investor questions about Ks, a hundred of them.
 Thats a hundred that all needs to be done precisely and perfectly for years.
 Of course, its a rolling years every time youre taking your fund, a year obligation.
 Whats actually been happening internally is, bit by bit, were actually turning the nonengineers in the company into engineers using LLMs.
 We have an inhouse tool that is effectively the operational nerve center that weve actually hooked up to GPT.
 Its like a flowcharting tool.
 You can pipe different parts of the workflow, and then you hook it up to GPT for different parts.
 You can say, for this set of emails that come in, automatically categorize all the emails.
 Okay, great.
 This ones a followon round for a Series A, this ones a new investment, this one is a tax question from an investor.
 Okay, great.
 Based on that, go down a certain path.
 Lets say its a Series A followon round that we need to review the docs and make sure all the investor rights are managed, make sure the cap table calculations are correct.
 Great.
 Read all the documents automatically, by the way.
 Categorize all the documents.
 Okay, weve got the cap table, weve got the share purchase agreement.
 We know that for every Series A followon document, we need X number of documents and select the cap tables missing.
 Automatically, we see the cap tables missing.
 Draft an email, autogenerate it, mind you.
 Its so funny.
 Youre saying this, and Im like, oh, my God, Ive been living this for the past several months.
 I know everything youre saying.
 Im like, yup, Ive experienced all of these.
 Like youre on the other side of these emails?
 Yeah.
 We just had one of our portfolio companies go public.
 We had some questions back and forth with the AngelList team.
 Ive started noticing on that and another one, you guys have been proactively suggesting, messaging in bullet points for us to tell our LPs.
 Now Im like, I see where this is coming from.
 This is amazing.
 Yup.
 Again, the reason were able to do this is because weve already been doing this for a long time.
 We have this massive set of training data.
 Its the best way you can use this data to fine tune.
 For example, going back to the Series A followon round, lets say the cap table is missing.
 Great.
 Hey, can we get the cap table automatically?
 Great.
 Now we get the cap table.
 Ingest the cap table through code, through LLM.
 Ingest it, structure it.
 By the way, weve already built tools for nonengineers in the company to build all of these automations for their workflows, and were seeing a lot of movement.
 Its actually fascinating.
 At AngelList Confidential, which is our annual conference, I actually did a fireside chat with Sam, and thats what opened my eyes.
 He said something to me that just stuck with me, which was that the cost of intelligence is going to zero.
 That just stuck so fiercely in my head that I basically took that and I was like, huh.
 Things that we assumed a human needed to do, they dont actually need to do anymore.
 If we can build tools inside the company for nonengineers to use, such that they can now take intelligence and automate it because the cost of intelligence is going to zero, well get insane leverage, insane automation coming out.
 This is crazy.
 This is going to have such a transformative effect on you as a business.
 I remember when we were investing in you guys.
 We got questions like, isnt that a super heavy servicesoriented business?
 As AngelList scales with funds, with companies, with everything, they need people to service all this stuff.
 This is a major unlock for you guys, right?
 Exactly.
 All you need to do is follow that cost of intelligence curve.
 The way to think about it is, as long as the tools are getting built out, such that humans can take their intelligence and automate that intelligence, because again, the cost of intelligence is going down to zero, youre going to see an insane amount of unlock, insane amount of leverage, and insane amount of automation.
 Of course, the companies that are best suited to take advantage of it are the ones who have a depth of experience, depth of training data, in order to be able to do it well.
 Those will win out quite a bit.
 The vertically integrated with good established software foundations like you guys.
 Exactly.
 You can then just imagine a hundred workflows with multiple agents per workflow.
 Its just a concept of how you chain all these different tasks and workflow and you automate different parts of it.
 Basically, think about it as all these bots that are running AngelList operations.
 If you visualize it, just visualize we have a few bots today, were going to have many bots in the future.
 Each of these bots are highly intelligent bots that are very, very good at a specific thing.
 Theyre essentially helping run the entire world of venture capital.
 Thats the way we think about it.
 Thats what gets us incredibly excited.
 Its so funny.
 Without realizing it, Im like, oh, yeah.
 Ive been on the other end of this for the last few months.
 I really have noticed a change in the nature of interactions with AngelList, the types of responses, and especially the proactiveness coming out of the platform.
 Now Im just like, oh, of course, its LLMs.
 Theres an interesting high level trend that youre hitting on here because five years ago, fundbacked offices were exclusively a low margin services business.
 Through all the software youve built and then this new edition of LLMs on top, you could really imagine it becoming a true gross margin SaaS business.
 Its this unlock of, oh, what other industries are perceived to be only possible to have services business margins, but actually could have software margins?
 Bingo.
 The assumption that all services businesses have low margins comes from a world where the cost of human intelligence was high, because there were things that computers just couldnt do, and there were things that required engineers to tell computers what to do.
 Lets cover both.
 There are some things that computers could not do.
 Computers could not solve these read an LPA.
 They can solve these unstructured problems or these fuzzy problems.
 They need a very precise problem to solve.
 Great, massive unlock.
 You can now solve fuzzy problems, things that you actually thought you needed a human to do.
 Its like a lot of pattern matching base, a very complex pattern matching.
 The second big unlock was, it used to be the case that you needed engineers to tell a computer what to do.
 Guess whats happened, English has turned into a programming language.
 You dont need an engineer to tell a computer what to do.
 By the way, theres a third big thing that is a huge unlock.
 There is no need for hardware adoption.
 Everyone already has a supercomputer in their hands.
 You have billion people in the world that are all connected on the Internet.
 Take all of those three combined, billion people connected with a supercomputer in their hands, they can tell a computer what to do using English, and the computer can do what they want it to do and solve the fuzzy problems, the cost of intelligence is not high anymore.
 Things that were typically limited by service margins, they wont anymore.
 Also, its not high and its also not linear, right?
 Yup.
 I think there may be a different problem to contend with now, which really may be differentiation.
 How do you now differentiate?
 Maybe thats what eventually drives costs down or the margins down, but thats where if you have specific moats, youre vertically integrated, or youre very specialized, you can actually have high margins.
 But I think the assumption that you need humans to do things and margins are low is an assumption of the old world, not the new one.
 By the way, the new one is coming fast.
 This is coming very, very, very fast.
 We add our all hands today.
 Every Tuesday, we do all hands.
 One of the teams thats been working with a lot of the internal tools that we have hooked up to GPT was sharing an automation they did.
 Everyone just went, wow, thats insane.
 Its coming so fast to all other companies.
 Were not the only unique company thats doing this in terms of looking at all the different parts that we can automate inside a company.
 You can imagine all the different use cases that are getting deployed very, very quickly.
 Were in the midst of the biggest technology wave, the biggest, .
 If youre willing to share, how many people work at AngelList right now?
 Were at ish total.
 That includes everything, including our back office, AngelList, any affiliated entities we have.
 It just includes everything, its like .
 Already today, the amount of capital that you manage across any dimensiondollars, number of entities, the number of investments, whatever you want to taketheres no way that only people can manage that in the old way.
 Zero chance.
 Andreessen has more than people working there.
 We shipped Ks last year.
 Its probably going to surpass that this year.
 You cant do that through humans sitting there just drafting these Ks and sending them out.
 Totally.
 Kindergarten alone, I think, is responsible for of those.
 Yeah, there is a significant amount of volume.
 AngelList really is at its heart.
 Were just a bunch of tinkerers and builders.
 Truly, it is founders building for founders.
 I basically got the build tools that I would use.
 I actually use every single product of AngelList, except for the cap table, I need to start a company.
 I was joking around like, I just have to start a company so I can use the last product I cant use right now, which is the cap table.
 The AngelList cap table isnt on AngelList?
 No, that one, but Im talking about myself as going through as a net new company.
 Im like, I just really want to use this cap table product.
 The one thing that is incredibly interesting about this moment and also about the correction that we went through around a lot of the layoffs in the tech industry, was really all of us finding our footing and ground of a technology company is meant to scale and increase the leverage per person, not scale headcount based on how the company is scaling.
 The way weve run AngelList has always been, how do we just bring together the brightest individuals who can really use leverage?
 What really are the forms of leverage?
 You have code capital humans.
 Humans are the worst form of leverage because leverage is a function of the humans you hire, so we really leaned pretty strongly on code.
 How can we actually get higher leverage per person?
 Thats how weve actually designed the company.
 We have different ways in which we have that force, function, and the constraint.
 One of the most recent ones is, this has been the case for a while.
 Ive basically said, hey, were going to keep our headcount constrained.
 Were still hiring new people.
 Thats natural as were backfilling roles.
 My message has been pretty clear.
 Were going to keep headcount constrained.
 Were going to force the decisions needed, such that were building more and more and more leverage to the business.
 This is something I actually picked up from early Square.
 Square was actually ahead of a few things on a lot of different trends.
 One of them was when I first was acquired by Square.
 The first message we received from Jack was, all right, Im not adding any more people in the company.
 Its a good forcing function for the company to really focus on the points of leverage and building out those points of leverage.
 There are all these things that I actually bring into the company and test around and play around.
 One of the other ones I love doing is Ill just cancel all my meetings every quarter and see what happens.
 If its important, Ill get back on.
 Sometimes Ill just cancel oneonones entirely.
 I love it.
 Its like garbage collection for your schedule.
 Exactly.
 This idea that theres a calendar invite that was set six months ago is even relevant in terms of the prioritization of today, makes no sense to me.
 Its really good to try out different things that help shock the system because thats really where, I think, teams and individuals can actually explore new things.
 Again, going back to increasing leverage for the company, there are things that we do that continuously test that and push on it.
 We take that very, very seriously.
 We really do believe in individual exceptionalism thats another thing.
 I really expect that any person that joins the company can create a new founding moment for the company.
 They can truly change the trajectory of the company because Ive been in and around founders for the better part of the last decade.
 Ive actually seen how a single individual can just change the world.
 I do believe everyone is capable of it.
 Thats another thing that we really believe in at AngelList.
 Its also like your whole business.
 Thats the customers, but thats the ecosystem you serve.
 You have the data right there.
 Exact.
 Its literally in our ethos.
 We truly do believe a single individual can change the world.
 Were serving them.
 Were actually serving the GPs who go back those individuals are going to change the world.
 It is a little ingrained in our ethos.
 As listeners think about the business of AngelList today, which is simplified, Wellfound has been spun out so theres no more talent.
 You mentioned Product Hunt, thats been spun out.
 Thats correct.
 The business of AngelList today, how does it break down?
 You dont have to give specific numbers, but how does AngelList make money?
 There are three customers of AngelList.
 The first one are the GPs.
 These are the folks who start SPVs, start funds.
 The second are the LPs.
 These are folks who invest behind the GPs.
 The last one are founders and startups.
 For the GPs, two products, SPVs' funds, pretty simple.
 For LPs, theyre typically investing behind the GPs, or sometimes theyll actually find other deals to invest in on the platform that is a part of the business, but the core part of the business really comes from the GPs in terms of starting SPVs and funds.
 The last one for founders and startups, really, its fundraising tools and cap table management.
 We actually launched cap tables last year.
 Its actually growing very, very quickly.
 Were incredibly excited about the rate of adoption on that product.
 Each one of these products has their own revenue model.
 For SPVs and funds, we charge an administrative fee to manage it over years.
 Can I just double click real quick on that?
 We didnt have a choice.
 Our first Kindergarten fund was million.
 There was no other way to do it except on AngelList.
 But then as we got bigger and managed more, having the experience of having started a firm before I made all the platform decisions, the cost of going with you guys to do that for the administrative fee, is night and day.
 Its a X difference versus doing it the traditional way.
 Exactly.
 Again, it goes back to because everything is vertically integrated in a single place, we can actually absorb all the different service providers in one and then provide a single price.
 Otherwise, you need to go and stitch together, and everyones going to quote you something different.
 You want tax provider, fund, admin, et cetera.
 Thats on the GP side.
 Thats how we make money.
 On the LP side, if theres a primary investment or secondary investment, if theres a primary investment or secondary investment that AngelList has helped facilitate and bring to the table, this is what we call AngelList LPs, then theres a brokers fee on that one.
 Where youre matching supply to demand between LPs and GPs.
 Exactly.
 By the way, you can actually see where that goes.
 The product strategy goes there around, look, today, a lot of it is primary investment, but were doing a lot of very interesting experimentation around how do we help funds provide their LPs' liquidity within the fund itself?
 This already happens offline today, and we think we have a unique approach there.
 Were going to be launching a product around that pretty soon.
 Thats where GPs control and manage.
 Thats on the LP side.
 Would that look something, Im just imagining, to Kindergarten, we have stakes in close to a hundred companies, many of them now are very wellknown, lots of people, would like to invest in those?
 Some of our LPs may want liquidity.
 AngelList would be a platform to manage that.
 Exactly.
 We can be the platform that manages that endtoend.
 We have a unique view on it as well.
 We think that we can help facilitate that in a single company in a portfolio as well.
 Again, once you get into the nuts and bolts of the LPA and the way you can Which in the old world, the only way that happened was, lets say I was Kindergarten, that needed to happen.
 I sold a piece of the whole commitment into Kindergarten, the whole blended fund, but you can atomize it to a company basis within a fund.
 Yup, we have a unique approach on how to do that and how to make that work.
 On the founder and startup side, the revenue model is a SaaS fee.
 Pretty straightforwardyoure managing the cap tables, we charge a SaaS fee.
 It depends on your size of company and the number of investors youre managing on the cap table.
 Then, there are other fees that get baked in because once youre a financial platform and youre moving money in and out of a financial platform, there are other different ancillary fees and everything that you can actually earn by reducing more and more friction.
 Thats the other piece thats not as well understood about AngelList.
 As a platform, it serves three different customers that have a portfolio of products.
 There are actually many revenue models that you can earn, especially as you get larger and larger.
 A lot of what were doing is just continuing to build out this platform.
 Were actually going to be launching a series of products over the next months that will further emphasize what product strategy we have and how were going to blanket the rest of venture.
 Were actually taking a lot of what weve built over the years.
 Were going to start unbundling pieces of it.
 Youll see how all of it is going to connect.
 Its a continuation of our strategy to move up market.
 Im very, very excited about this.
 Our team is just pretty jazzed building this out.
 Its a part of the evolution of a platform.
 Thats another revenue model that starts coming in as well.
 On the breakdown question, I have to imagine, SPVs were a large part of the business before.
 It seems like the funds business has to be meaningfully larger today than SPVs ever was.
 It is.
 Even before the market crash last year, May of the SPV business was not the largest part of the business.
 Thats actually a fact that most people may not know, but SPVs havent been the largest part of the business for a while now.
 The funds part of the business is definitely the largest part by many multiples.
 Interesting.
 Very interesting.
 Some people may think of SPVs as the key thing.
 Dont get me wrong, were going to continue to support SPVs.
 Were still the market leader in SPVs.
 Its a very important component of our product portfolio.
 But AngelList is firmly in the funds business as well and actually has a very strong stronghold in the funds business.
 Each time we go into a new target in terms of fund size as we keep moving up market, if you map our market share each time we enter a new fund size, we essentially take the market each time.
 We just fundamentally just absorb it, take it, then we move on, and then move to the next one, and the next one.
 Just by virtue of us building that out, the fund side of the business is just much larger.
 Theres something thats in my mind on the SPV, and fund dynamic has been the case.
 I dont know if its just my experience or if this also reflects the broader market, which you have the purview of.
 To me, SPVs have really changed over the last five years from being a way for individuals and groups to invest in companies that otherwise they wouldnt be able to, to more of an elastic scaling product for funds, or at least thats how I think about it.
 We have core funds that we invest out of, that are blind pools.
 Then when we have opportunities to write larger checks, we use SPVs to flex up on certain investments.
 Is that the primary use case of them now or is that just my use case of them?
 I would say thats one of the use cases, where a fund uses an SPV to amplify the check they could be writing into a company.
 The other use case are GPs who are just running SPVs, and not writing checks from their funds.
 The SPV business segments into two types of GPs, one who are doing exactly what you said, amplifying checks from the fund, and then the other GPs are only doing SPVs as the primary thing.
 The use case for both actually looks very, very different.
 Anyone whos amplifying from the fund, typically is really looking to bring their LPs in on an opportunity where they can invest behind the company if you can get a larger allocation.
 The ones who are only investing in SPVs are really optimizing around AngelList LPs, how can you bring more dollars into a company.
 It really bifurcates into the two, and they do look very, very different.
 Those two different types of SPVs and what we were just talking about there, to methats a good way to start to wrap things up hereits really changed my thinking on what a venture firm and fund can and should be in the preAngelList world, preatomized, presoftwareatized world of this.
 You needed a certain fund size to just be able to do things.
 Your strategy was literally limited and dictated by the size of your fund.
 Thats now no longer the case because whatever your core fund size is, or at least this is how I think about it, you still can do much larger in different things by amplifying via SPVs.
 The complexity around that is enormous, but I think its really interesting.
 Its, in many ways, a better product as I think about it for all the participants in the ecosystem as a GP.
 I can get dealbydeal economics on my high conviction.
 Thats where I have access as an LP.
 I dont have to commit tons of capital to this blind pool, or I dont know whats going to happen with it.
 As a company and a founder, I still can go.
 These days, I am going to the large established funds to be my leads and all my rounds, but I can get a lot of capital from these other folks that I otherwise couldnt get.
 What were noticing as well, if we rewind back to a few years ago, is that founders werent as familiar with SPVs.
 The world of venture has always been this very mystical to founders.
 If we fast forward to today, with AngelList RUVs rollup vehicles which are fundraising tools, weve normalized this idea of a vehicle where you can bring many checks in, and its a single line item on the cap table.
 What weve noticed is because of that, more founders have been educated out of the gate on what SPVs are and also more and more open SPVs if you just crack it over time.
 I think theres also been a shift in the Overton window around SPVs, understanding rollup vehicles.
 All of this coming together actually does firmly go into the world and lead into a world, where founders are going to be more and more willing to take smaller and smaller checks wrapped up into an SPV or wrapped up into a rollup vehicle and really get the supporters to help them build the company.
 I think thats incredibly important.
 Were seeing this across the board.
 Were actually regularly seeing large established venture funds, educating founders to go to an RUV because theyre saying, use this as a way to bring on helpful operators and investors into a simple cap table line item.
 I think were firmly in this world of, how do you bring on many more people to help support the company so you can continue to build your company?
 Nothing better exemplifies your longterm vision than that.

 Listeners, well see you next time.
 may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate andor amusing transcription errors Welcome to season episode of Acquired.
 The podcast about great technology companies, the stories, and playbooks behind them.
 Im Ben Gilbert, and I am the cofounder and managing director of Seattlebased Pioneer Square Labs, and our Venture fund, PSL Ventures.
 And Im David Rosenthal, and Im an angel investor based in San Francisco.
 And we are your hosts.
 Well, David, here we are, the final episode in our Berkshire Trilogy.
 We were texting about this.
 I feel like were like bungee developing the Halo franchise.
 Halo was supposed to be the Finish the fight.
 Were going to finish the fight.
 Last time was supposed to be the end.
 Were back for number three, and Halo was so good.
 It was so good.
 That was the best.
 See, now we have a lot to live up to.
 Well, listeners, we told you about Warrens literally perfect record with the Buffett Partnerships in the s, where he generated a positive return and beat the stock market every single year for years.
 We then wandered the path with Warren of consolidating his investments into Berkshire Hathaway, joining forces with Charlie, swerving through regulators, and coming out unscathed?
 Question mark?
 Yeah.
 When we last left off, Warren and Charlie were in finishing up an absolutely monster run of returning over per year for years.
 Spoiler alert.
 Not going to be the case this time.
 No.
 Those were no doubt Berkshires glory days.
 Today we will tell quite a different story.
 A story of what happens when a timetested investment philosophy gets confronted with systemic changes in the world, like the PC and the Internet.
 Concurrently, while the world was changing, so was Berkshire by virtue of their own success.
 When you now need to write billion dollar checks to move the needle, theres only so many places you can go knocking.
 All those places are quite visible to other investors, too.
 Today on part three, we will tell the story of the large and mature Berkshire Hathaway, and examine what the future may hold with the next generation.
 Listeners, are you an Acquired Slack member?
 If not, come join us.
 The most recent thing that I want to highlight is the digital assets channel.
 It is one of the best entry points Ive seen on the web for people to discuss everything going on in the crypto landscape.
 Yes, I just said crypto on the Berkshire episode in a very thoughtful and nuanced way.
 Its just a great discussion going on there.
 Its also great for beginners.
 As always, come join us, acquired.
fmslack.
 Now, on to our presenting sponsor for all of season eight, Tiny.
 Today we will continue our exclusive interview miniseries with Jeremy on building wonderful, internet businesses.
 Jeremy, we are living in a world of increasing financing options.
 Venture capital was the only sort of financing available for tech companies in the s.
 We now have everything from venture debt to revenue loans, to lending against contracts like our fellow sponsor, CapChase.
 How do you think about the forms of alternative financing thats available to companies now?
 I think good old financial literacy is really underrated in entrepreneurs these days.
 Perhaps its a reaction to the MBAs of the dotcom era.
 But I think its very surprising to me how many very successful founders and entrepreneurs dont really understandeven basicallywhat a capital structure is, or how you can borrow money from a bank, or do all sorts of things.
 I think part of that is because of the simplicity of the funding model on the West coast.
 Theres just much more financial sophistication, say, in private equity in New York or something like that.
 I think founders should absolutely try and brush up a little bit on their financial knowledge because as any kind of firstyear analyst in New York will tell you, equity dollars are always the most expensive form of money, but oftentimes its the only trick that the founder knows when theres really a lot of different sources of capital that they could or should be tapping.
 Really keen insight.
 Thank you so much.
 Thank you to Tiny.

fmlp.
 We cant wait to see you there.
 David, before you take us in, listeners, as always, this show is not investment advice.
 David and I mayand I think Ive already told you some of us dohave investments in the companies we discuss.
 The show is for informational and entertainment purposes only.
 David Rosenthal, tell us a story.
 All right.
 Well, as you said at the top of the show, last we left Warren and Charlie in theyin particular Warrenare heroes.
 Times have never been better, its great.
 Warren is a legend.
 He literally, singlehandedly reversed a federal government decision and saved Salomon Brothers.
 Its crazy.
 His stature is unparalleled.
 Nothing that the finance, corporate, investing, or business world has ever seen.
 His the oracle of Omaha, people are flocking to the annual meetings, literally the annual shareholder meetings.
 Of course, Woodstock for capitalism.
 Woodstock for capitalists, is attracting thousands of people.
 And it grew.
 Of course, there were a handful of people that would gather in the basement, and then there was at a hotel, and then it was at a larger venue, and by this point hes entering arena territory.
 Hes literally filling arenas like a rockstar.
 Berkshire stock passes a share.
 Far and away, the highest setpriced single share of stock in history.
 Buffett himself is worth over billion.
 Hes rocketing up the Forbes list.
 But there is one person out there in America and the world who is moving up that list faster than Warren.
 And fate is about to bring these two gentlemen together.
 Oh man, so we left on the Salomon Brothers saga, and were riding in with Bill Gates.
 Is that what youre telling me David?
 Were riding in with BG, Bill Gates.
 Man, hes been in the news a lot lately.
 Yeah.
 Thats another topic for another day.
 Back in the previous summer of before Salomon, which would start going down in the fall of and wrap up in .
 But before everything really kind of hits the fan, Kay Graham arranges for a Fourth of July weekend bash on Bainbridge Island in Seattle.
 No way.
 What a wonderful place.
 Bainbridge is one of the best places in the world.
 Yeah.
 Its a mere ferry ride from Seattle, and then you feel like youre millions of miles away from civilization.
 Totally.
 She invites Warren along, of course.
 Part of the festivities that are planned is that on the th of July of theyre going to go over to the Hood Canal, and spend all day with a very prominent Seattle area family, Mary and Bill Gates II, better known as Sr.
 And potentially their son, Bill Gates III, might drop by at some point during the day.
 And this is famously his sort of family home growing up.
 He learns to swim out there.
 His father is a very prominent lawyer, an angel investor, and sort of galvanizer of the Seattle Startup Community from the early days.
 His moms on the board of the United Way.
 Yup.
 This is long before Microsoft, but already sort of a prominent family in the area.
 Warren is a little reluctant to go on this trip.
 This is not sort of his thing, but as he puts it, anything for Kay.
 He goes out.
 He joins Kay and a few others this weekend.
 Similarly, Bill Gates III does not have a lot of interest in going out on the fifth for this allday event.
 Hes super busy, hes running Microsoft, its a public company, he wants to stay in Redmond, and work, work, work.
 But Mary, his mom, forces him to come out.
 Bill would say later, as I told my mom, I dont know about meeting a guy who just invests in money and picks stocks.
 Of course, hes talking about meeting Warren.
 His parents, you got to come meet Warren.
 Bill continues, I dont have many good questions for him.
 Thats not my thing.
 I love how Gates judges the quality of his social time by the quality of questions that he can have for somebody.
 Quick side note.
 Watching these old videos of Gates, were so used to his polished image now, but when you go and you watch some videos of them from this time frame, especially in the early s, hes obviously so brilliant.
 But hes Hes madawkward.
 Yeah.
 Hes vigorous in the way that he sort of attacks lines of questioning and engages with challenges, and hes assuming you are not the subject of his ire, its a really fascinating thing to watch, and totally different from the Gates youre sort of familiar with now.
 Yeah, thats a good point.
 Mary, though, forces Bill to come out.
 Shes still his mom, but what hes going to do, hes going to come later in the day, hes going to fly in on a helicopter so that he can get a good  of a day working.
 This is July th at Microsoft.
 Weve talked about this on the show, but Microsoft in all throughout the s until the DOJ case, it was intense.
 They were killers there.
 Yeah.
 You should think about it like Uber in .
 Totally, so Bills plan is hes gonna fly it on the helicopter, and then hes going to make the helicopter wait there, hell eat dinner, and its gonna fly out and escape, go back to work.
 Hes introduced to Warren, and Warren immediately asks Bill what Bill thinks of IBM and whether theyre going to do well in the future.
 I cannot believe were going to get to this much later in the episode, but Warren is already obsessed with IBM.
 My God, Warren.
 Dont buy IBM, previewing that, like dont do it.
 Dont do it.
 Gates, of course agrees with me here and hes like, no, you should absolutely not buy IBM.
 You should buy two stocks, and two stocks Microsoft and Intel.
 And you should buy nothing else, and you should just hold them.
 This is so Microsoft at this point has about a billion market cap, and Intel has a billion market cap.
 Oh my God.
 Gates is so deep in it, so obviously hes right here.
 But it is incredible that IBM, even though they made the computers, the value in the value chain did not accrue to them in any way, shape, or form.
 They became completely dumb terminals and all of the value is captured by the chip maker, and by the operating system maker, which blindsided everyone.
 Just a brilliant business strategy.
 Totally brilliant business strategy.
 So Gates then was probably pretty annoyed by this first question, given that he doesnt care about stocks.
 Hes like, buy these two, just buy these, dont do anything else.
 Probably just listen to Bill Gates here.
 Gates turns around and asks Buffett about newspapers, because Gates is probably already starting to think about coming after newspapers as part of, I dont know if Encarta existed already at this point, but Microsoft is spinning up all sorts of stuff.
 Encarta, I was thinking of an encyclopedia, but then they would launch Live, and with the coming of the Internet.
 All sorts of stuff.
 They were launching these things interestingly enough in the time frame.
 And theres this unbelievable interview that Bill Gates does with WiredIll look it up and see if I can link it in the show noteswhere hes basically combatively arguing that content clubs could never be Microsofts next business, that theyre just not big enough.
 You dont understand how big Windows is.
 These are multibillion dollar businesses.
 Unless you become Disney or something, content clubs are just never going to cut it.
 Its fascinating looking at that aggressive reaction by Gates and how he feels versus the market cap of saying Netflix today or how important is it to Amazon Prime strategy to have a content club, as we talked about with Brad on the last episode.
 So Gates, at this point thinking, oh, we got a tiger by the tail with this Windows thing.
 There are few other businesses as big as this one.
 Lets just go for the billion opportunities.
 Yup.
 Heres where Buffett sort of surprises Gates.
 Buffett is like American newspapermen number one.
 Started as the paperboy, its the canonical franchise business.
 He owns, based on the board of the Washington Post, owns Buffalo Evening News, all the stuff.
 Hes like, look.
 Today, newspapers are the best business out there.
 Im thrilled to own them, but I got to be honest with you.
 I am starting to worry about their future.
 He doesnt know anything about the Internet.
 Hes actually not worried from that front but he says, Im worried about the encouragement of TV, and in particular, cable television, and peoples news habits shifting television, encroaching on newspapers.
 Bills like, okay, interesting, thats not quite the answer I expected from Mr.
 Buffett.
 They start talking and they sort of fall into conversation.
 And knowing the two of them a little bit, not personally, but through the show, you can imagine that they just sort of spend the whole day talking.
 Other people are there, Kays there, Bills parents are there, a bunch of other Seattlearea sort of dignitary stop by, two of the future founders of Madrona stop by, Bill Ruckelshaus who was an amazing man, part of the Saturday Night Massacre in the Nixon Administration, the first head of the EPA, Jerry Grinstein who is CEO of Burlington Northern.
 I have no idea.
 Oh, wow.
 drop by, lives in Seattle.
 Wasnt he the one to become the CEO of Delta Airlines?
 He would.
 Another erstwhile later in life Warren investment.
 Well get there.
 Warren and Bill just totally ignore them.
 They were super engrossed with one another.
 At dinner, theyre all there.
 I guess theyre forced to sit down and join the group for dinner.
 Bill Gates Sr.
 asked this odd guest group assembled there, what factor does everybody think has been most important in achieving where youve gotten in life?
 And there were people at this table whove gotten very far in life.
 Bill and Warren, both immediately reply with one word, which is focus.
 These guys are like two peas in a pod.
 After dinner, the sun goes down, and the helicopter leaves.
 Bill Gates III stays.
 Woah.
 Yeah.
 Warren has drawn him away from his work.
 Amazing.
 As they become fast friends, Buffett goes back to Omaha after the holiday, and on the first dayI dont know when the fourth, the fifth fell, but on Monday, whatever the first trading day is after thathe makes another of his fateful, immediate, splitsecond, gut stock purchases.
 Tell us he bought Microsoft, David.
 He did buy Microsoft, just like he did with GEICO.
 Oh, I actually didnt realize he did.
 He bought shares of Microsoft for his personal account, so that he could keep up with his friend Bill Gates.
 Isnt that ridiculous?
 And he buys zero Intel shares.
 Again, even giving his history with Intel and Noyce.
 Which in retrospect feels like such a fraught strategy because not only are you losing out on the benefit of all the upside of actually being a shareholder in your vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, you now want to spend a lot of time and dive deep with this person and hes an insider.
 And now you personally own shares in his company, so you cant actually get a lot of the information that you want to talk about with them, because its too sensitive, because youre a shareholder in a super meaningless way.
 This decision is confounding.
 Completely confounding.
 But he does invite Bill to join the Graham Group, which is by now the Buffet group, his group of cronies.
 At the next meeting, which I think is in Vancouver, one of the sessions theyre all kicking around their favorite stock ideas, and Bill Ruane from the Sequoia fund throws out Kodak as a name hes thinking about.
 Bill Gates immediately responds, Kodak is toast.
 I love it.
 Its so great.
 Of course, Tom Murphy is there, and Kays there as well theyre both television media magnates.
 They asked Bill whether he thinks television is toast, too, and Bill respondsthis is a quote from The SnowballNo, its not that simple.
 The way networks create and expose shows is different from camera film, like Kodak, and nothing is going to come in and fundamentally change that.
 Youll see some fall off as people move toward variety.
 But the networks own the content and they can repurpose it.
 The networks face an interesting challenge as we move from the transport of TV onto the Internet.
 But its not like photography where you get rid of film, so knowing how to make film becomes absolutely irrelevant.
 This is crazy.
 This is .
 That is a brilliant impression.
 Gates just described the next years of media and the Internet right there.
 Wow.
 Isnt that unbelievable?
 Yeah, I think its actually a Buffett quote, Predicting rain doesnt count.
 Building the ark does.
 I love this one so much because there are so many of these.
 Look at Steve Jobs describing the cloud in or whatever it is.
 Or look at Bill Gates predicting how the media landscape would evolve based on technology.
 And yet, neither of those actually came to fruition where they became the market leader in that given thing that they clearly articulated in that captured and quoted video.
 Yeah, its interesting.
 Personal life aside, Ill give Gates the benefit of the doubt here.
 I bet Microsoft would have made plays here if not for the antitrust case of the DOJ.
 Theyre working to extend their advantage to the media.
 Yeah, exactly.
 They were going to embrace and extend there.
 Okay, so were going to come back to Bill in a minute, and theres a very, very important reason why.
 Its just like he has such an impact on Warrens life in so many ways, as well see throughout this episode.
 But I think this is also a really great lens to view this part three of, lets contrast Bill Gates and Warren Buffett as we go along here.
 There is more than one, but one in particular other very famous Warren Buffetts Berkshire classic investment that we have not yet covered in our twoparts thus far.
 You talked about it on the cold opener in the last episode, but we actually havent touched it in the real story.
 I know, I know.
 Of course, we were talking about Coke and Warrens investment in it, which is just classic Buffett in so many ways.
 Its just unbelievable.
 Back when Warren was starting up his partnerships, way backwere going back to part one of the episodesin the late s, he got to know one of his neighbors in Omaha.
 I cant believe that all of his great investment comes from his neighbors in Omaha.
 Their kids played together, this neighbor is named Don Keough, and they both live on Farnam Street in Omaha.
 Side note, which is why Farnam Street is, and the Knowledge Project, and Shane, and everything he does over there is called Its an amazing name.
 Farnam Street.
 Keough was a Salesman for the ButterNut Coffee Company at the time and he had six kids.
 The story goes that as Warren is starting up his partnerships he asked Don how hes planning to save for college for all of his kids.
 His thinking like, hey, Im going to get Don on this partnership thing get some money out of him.
 Don is pretty sharp, though.
 He asks his kids what they think of Mr.
 Buffett.
 And his kids are like, oh we love Mr.
 Buffett.
 Hes great, hes always at home.
 Whenever were playing with little Susie, Howie, and Peter, hes there.
 He didnt bother us, but he said, hmm.
 Don is like, well, this guy clearly doesnt work very hard.
 Hes always at home during the day.
 Im not giving him my money.
 Soon after that, though, in ButterNut was acquired by the Duncan Coffee Company.
 Don moves to Houston, he leaves Omaha with that.
 Then shortly after in Duncan gets acquired by CocaCola, and Don moves to Atlanta.
 Fast forward to the mids.
 By this point in time, Don is president and COO of Coke.
 He is the Dan Burke, one might say, to the Tom Murphy of the legendary Coke CEO at the time, Roberto Goizueta, who is an incredible CEO.
 Cuban immigrant, ran Coke through all the great ascendancy of the company.
 At this point now, Warren is a man about Washington, thanks to the Post and Kay.
 One night, he gets invited to dinner at The White House, I assume either thanks to Kay, or as her date there or something.
 And lo and behold who shows up at the White House?
 Don.
 His neighbor from thats crazy.
 Yeah.
 They reconnect at the White House, his neighbor from Farnam Street.
 Dons like, oh, yeah, Im COO of Coke now.
 I take it that Warren has fully switched from Pepsi to drinking CocaCola at this point?
 No, not yet.
 Oh.
 Don converts him.
 Warren is like, hey, really great to reconnect.
 I remember you didnt give me the money back in the day.
 How are you feeling about that now?
 I dont know if he said that.
 Warren says, thats great, Don.
 Im happy for you.
 Im kind of a Pepsi guy, though.
 Really what I like to do, I have Pepsi all day, every day.
 I put in Cherry syrup in it and its great.
 Dons like Warren, we just launched a new product.
 Weve got the product for you.
 You dont have to put the syrup in your Pepsi anymore.
 Weve got Cherry Coke.
 That was incredible.
 I think they launched it I want to say, maybe, sometime around then.
 Also I didnt realize that the fact that the coffee company got rolled up into Coke, and I presume the s, they werent conglomerating earlier than I thought.
 I mean, obviously CocaCola is a multihundredyearold brand, but they were single product for the majority of their life.
 I assumed it was the s and s when they started becoming this big portfolio of beverage brands, but it sounds like it was much earlier.
 It was and they were buying other stuff.
 I dont know how big it was versus the cola business.
 Anyway, with Cherry Coke, Don convinces Warren to switch.
 That of course causes Warren to start thinking like, oh, well, maybe I should take a look at investing in Coke.
 He becomes intrigued.
 As he digs in, I think this was or so, maybe it was in I think.
 A couple years earlier, they had launched Diet Coke, and Diet Coke was like a monster.
 CocaCola, now Classic, as we will get into in a second, was great, but Diet Coke is huge, maybe the most successful beverage product launch of all time.
 Its a blockbuster.
 So Warrens intrigued, but he thinks, hey, stock price is kind of high.
 Ill just keep an eye on it.
 And then New Coke happens.
 I knew about and Ive read about, but do you remember this Ben?
 How do you mess this up?
 If youre a company like CocaCola, and you got all these big brains around the table, and you basically have a thing thats a trade secretyou dont have any IP protection around it but you have the magic formulaand you have the brandnot yet worldrenowned but sort of a nation renowned brand that is synonymous with, like your sense of patriotism and its associated with one particular, very odd, very wellbalanced flavorhow on Earth do you replace that?
 What are you thinking?
 I thinkthe preview of it hereWarren would always say that theget everybody in trouble in a minutething he liked about Coke is that if a business could be run by a ham sandwich, literally just like Evidently not.
 Evidently not.
 I think they were probably just so bored.
 At least a ham sandwich wouldnt mess with the golden goose.
 Totally.
 To be fair, the rest of the story is they ran all these blind taste tests, and Pepsi had been making headway with market share.
 That delicious lemony, weird, sweet thing they had going on.
 They try new flavors, and one of them tests really well.
 People like it better than the old Coke recipe.
 They literally pulled the old Coke recipe off the shelves and introduced new Coke, and it is an unmitigated disaster.
 Pepsis like, oh my God, this is the greatest unforced error in history.
 They start a price war.
 Coke gets into a huge fight with its bottlers.
 The stock plunges.
 And the rumor starts going around that Ron Perelman, the same dude from Salomon, is circling.
 The Revlon, gone activist investor, and guy.
 How could we have forgotten about this in the last episode?
 He was the villain in Marvel.
 Thats right.
 Remember way back in the day our Marvel episode?
 I forget that he owned it for a while, and ran it into the ground.
 Perelman, what a guy.
 Rumours going around hes targeting Coke now in the wake of the New Coke disaster.
 Enter white knight Warren to save the day, as always.
 He rides in, he buys .
 billion worth of stock on the open market in which equates to of the company, and then just like good friends with Salomon, Goizueta, and Keogh asked him to join the board which, of course, he does.
 Side note, the CocaCola board is where Warren meets Herb Allen from Allen Company, and starts going to Sun Valley every year.
 Everythings coming up roses for Warren here.
 To like a company and be sort of prospecting it, just to watch them go through the New Coke thing, just be sitting there and grinning like an idiot, like this is my chance.
 The trick is knowing how to feel those in the moment, when youre not catching a knife that is falling but rather buying the dip, as they say.
 Warren Buffett, the OG buythedip investor.
 And to add a little more nuance to that, he does have this great strategy of identifying an opportunity where a company has its back against a wall, because there are activist shareholders or theres a deal that was on the table thats fallen through and suddenly they need cash fast, he very much uses this lack of necessary approval by committees and red tape to just come in with cash, make an offer he feels good about, its sort of that better to be approximately right than precisely wrong, kind of that approximately right.
 I eyeballed it, it looked good, I came in, I bought it, and now Im a big shareholder, and it was a pretty good price.
 Yeah.
 I hope at some point that Warren and Charlie send a case of wine over to Ron Perelman because like, man, they got some deals because of that guy.
 In the Berkshire letter to shareholders, Buffett announces the Coke investment saying of it, We expect to hold these securities, the securities in Coke, for a long time.
 In fact, when we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.
 By the mid s, a few years later, Coke had recovered from the New Coke disaster.
 They have massively expanded internationally, the late s and then through the s when Coke went from being still associated with Americana, but like everybody in America drank it, to everybody in the world drank Coke.
 This was part of the investment thesis, too, that there was sort of this unexplored, massive opportunity to bring CocaCola to the rest of the world, particularly through this brilliant innovative strategy that they have of just selling the syrup.
 Whether theyre selling it to the restaurants that are putting it in the fountains or whether theyre selling it to the bottlers who have to figure out water and carbonation everything locally, they just are shipping the concentrate around the world.
 So its reasonably costeffective to have just a few places that need to know the secret formula and make this stuff.
 It really can be a globally addressable market.
 Its good work if you can get it for a ham sandwich.
 Coke is printing money within a decade.
 Berkshire is up over X on Coke, and since thenthat was from mids to midsBerkshires only up less than X on Coke from that point in time over the last Really?
 Yeah.
 What is years?
 Thats wild.
 Yeah.
 So X returns in the first decade, and X in the next which would sort of presage things to come.
 Compounding large numbers, David, sure is hard.
 It turns out it is.
 While were on this Coke thing, before we sort of leave it, I do think this is a good moment to address the value of the brand.
 We sort of alluded to moats, especially in the Seven Powers discussion in our previous episode.
 But we havent actually described how Warren thinks about moats, and sort of brand as a moat.
 In the annual meeting, he has this great quote where he just lays it out for investors, and its one of these rare moments where he describes the investment strategy I think more than he necessarily intended to, but hes off the cuff, hes answering a question, and he says, What were trying to find is a business that for one reason or another, it can be because its the lowcost producer in some area, it can be because it has a natural franchise, because of surface capabilities, it could be because of his position and the consumers mind, it could be because of a technological advantage, or any kind of reason at all that it has this moat around it.
 I just always thought this is the clearest articulation of his view of sustainable competitive advantage.
 What makes a business durable and able to generate outsized profits over time.
 And boy, did they nail it with Coke.
 I mean, this is just one of these classic examples of the brand moat is really real and its a global brand moat.
 Totally.
 The moat exists, clear how it works.
 Its straight over tackle.
 If youve taken this international, run the same playbook.
 Yeah, great timing coming in in the New Coke disaster right before international expansion.
 Well done, Warren.
 Okay, David.
 You did mention that CocaColas only up another X after that initial X.
 When we look at that sort of late s time, looking at maybe CocaCola did represent close to of Berkshires equity portfolio construction.
 That was X on their initial investment.
 Of the stuff that they own that are public markets before they wade into Applewell talk about laterCocaCola is their biggest single holding of stock that they dont wholly own in a business.
 Yeah, and no longer is, but yeah, this is huge.
 This is one of the key legs of the Berkshire stool is Coke.
 And also just speaks to how different the company is now.
 You can barely see the Coke equity value there.
 Back to the meeting of these two businesses here.
 In there was this amazingly perfect moment.
 I think, this moment kind of marks a major transition point in business and industry in the world.
 It starts with the rise of tech and the rise of the Internet, and how much the world is going to change.
 It reminds me of a famous quote in history.
 I think its about Germany in the s, where the quote is, The German history reached its turning point and Germany failed to turn.
 This applies to Warren here.
 Investing in corporate history reached its turning point and Warren failed to turn.
 So summer we were at the Allen Company Sun Valley Conference, and there was a panel discussion hosted by Don Keough with three participants, being Warren, Roberto Goizutea, the CEO of Coke, and Bill Gates.
 So here it is, old school, the consumer brand, Coke Bill Gates and Microsoft and Warren on the same stage.
 Everybody thinks this is going to be like a backpatting affair.
 Maybe sort of a genteel changing of the guard, or something like that.
 But Bill kind of goes off script here.
 So Bill would later say that he meant this as a compliment.
 But he trots out Warrens ham sandwich phrase when talking about Roberto and Don on stage.
 Oh, wow.
 Wait, so you have the moderator of the panel as the president of Coke, and youve got the CEO of Coke as one of the participants?
 Yeah, and then the other participant is the largest shareholder in Coke and Gates friend.
 Gates says that, oh, you guys got it easy.
 Your ham sandwich could run your business.
 And he compares that to Microsoft.
 He contrasts that with Microsoft where he says, running Microsoft is such a highwire act, that he suspects hes going to have to retire before he gets too old.
 Indeed he says, well, before he gets to age because you need a young person in charge who can adapt and navigate the constant change in the technology business.
 The other panel is Roberto is and tragically later that year would die unexpectedly and very quickly of lung cancer.
 Don is and Warren is so Gates is literally just slapping them all in the face here.
 Roberto has the sort of stereotypically fiery Cuban temper here.
 He is hugely offended by this.
 I dont think he walks off stage, but he never talks to Gates again for the rest of his life, after this episode.
 I dont know how Don reacted to it.
 Warren kind of shrugs it off like he does, like hey, Bills my friend.
 Hes Bill.
 Hes kind of like that.
 Hes like a wild animal.
 You cant bring him in public too much.
 The thing is, this is a major social faux pas in Gates part, but hes totally freaking right.
 Hes right, and it is clearly this seminal moment for Warren where hes sort of looking left and hes seeing the past.
 Hes seeing the things he already owns.
 Hes seeing these cashflowing, profitable, durable businesses.
 And he looks right, and hes seeing something he doesnt understand with Microsoft.
 Its outside the circle of his confidence, so its in Charlies too hard pile, to use a Charlieism there.
 Hes team Coke.
 Hes team durable, understandable, oldworld businesses.
 In this era, theres so many opportunities for him to run toward the fire in technology, and he just chooses not to.
 He just runs away.
 Alice has this great quote in The Snowball.
 She says, Buffett avoided technology stocks partly because these fastmoving businesses could never be run by a ham sandwich.
 He thought it no shame to have a business that could be run by a ham sandwich he wanted to get Berkshire Hathaway to the point where it could be run by a ham sandwich, too.
 So not until after he was gone.
 I get it.
 I used to think this too, actually.
 I was like, oh man, I really want to find businesses that like a monkey could run.
 The thing is those businesses dont exist anymore.
 They exist, like Coke still exists, and its fine, and plenty of these other businesses.
 But Gates is so right here.
 The future is changing and the most valuable companies of the future and the most value thats going to be created are going to be created by companies, leaders, and entrepreneurs who are able to navigate change.
 You mentioned we just had Brad in our last episode, Brad Stone to talk about Amazon Unbound.
 You read that book and you just take it kind of in awe.
 Bezos is the worlds richest person and he is still bringing such intensity.
 We cannot rest on our laurels, we have to change, we have to innovate every single day.
 This is not Coke.
 Yeah.
 Well, okay.
 Lets take this as the moment to dive a little bit deeper into why Buffett doesnt like tech stocks.
 Because its so in our culture today that he sort of is not a tech investor.
 Its worth unpacking it a little bit.
 He did have this interesting observation, I think it was in the late s, that were going to talk about the dot com bubble here.
 There arent any internet companies that have ever hit a hundred million in a year in profits.
 I have no proof that it could possibly exist.
 Warren is investing, not speculating.
 A lot of people will take offense to me saying that a lot of technology investing, especially in the early stages, is speculating.
 But the fact is, very early on theres no revenue and theres certainly no profit, so you cant possibly do investing in the classic sense of valuing the business today at a discount to its future cash flows.
 Speculating in a risk managed way by putting your money in great people, going after markets with promising futures, the sort of secular tailwind argument.
 In fact, Buffett has a very particular way that he thinks about valuation, that is highly sensitive to how certain the future is.
 Hes willing to pay up for very certain futures, which is why he values the brand so much.
 And if you think about this as like an expected value equation, where you have two components, the value of something, if it happens and then the probability that it will happen.
 Buffett is happy to pay for things with a modest value, but a high probability of it happening.
 But its not his style at all to make bets on low probability, very high potential value plays, like would be an Amazon or something that youre sort of talking about, David, when you reference this incredibly, nimble, rapidly adapting world.
 Where the chess boards are constantly rearranging and you sort of need to make a bunch of high beta bets.
 Yup.
 Totally.
 I think the problem is that, now, well get to now, later in the episode.
 But the world has just evolved to the point where, like, thats the way the world works.
 Theres so much change, and its so constant that even Amazon, even Apple, even Microsoft need to be thinking that way.
 And if you dont think that way, you can be Coke but like Cokes value has only .
xed in years.
 Those are the businesses youre going to get.
 Our friend, Andrew Marks, whos a great VC at TQ Ventures.
 Hes actually known Warren and studied him for basically his whole life.
 He told me that, I think the best way to put this about Warren that Ive ever heard, is that Warren was the worlds greatest status quo investor.
 As long as the future was mostly going to look like the present, Warren is a savant at that type of investing.
 The future for Coke is mostly going to look like the present for Coke.
 He knows how to value that.
 He knows that theyre going to recover from New Coke.
 He knows that theres an opportunity internationally, he can invest in that, he can see that.
 Right.
 So youre saying that, of course, the business will change, and evolve, and grow but the chessboard The world is the chess world.
 The world is reasonably static.
 Is reasonably static, yeah.
 That makes sense.
 For most of his life thats been the case.
 Right.
 You hear comments like people are always going to love candy.
 People are always gonna like Coke, like its not a bet on the world changing, its a bet on someone operating a business really well in the world.
 Yeah, he used to say that he was absolutely certain as long as cola doesnt cause cancer that more people are going to swallow Coke tomorrow than they did today.
 Well, it turns out sugar is kind of linked to cancer.
 Thats kind of not a good play.
 The world changes.
 I think this is the thing, were now this is what this moment to me represents, this panel at Sun Valley in is like this is the transition to a world where more change is happening than not.
 Yeah, its like that.
 Theres a great weight, but why graphic, where the little stick figure is standing on the inflection point of an exponential curve.
 And its not that the world wasnt changing quickly between the mids and the early s.
 It was that the rate of change hadnt compounded to the point where it was suddenly, like the whole world is changing all at once.
 You have the arrival of the Internet, the cycles of innovation are getting wildly compressed.
 I mean, we live in this world today, where theres huge changes in the sentiment of the future, like multiple news cycles per day in a super high fidelity, highfrequency way.
 Crypto.
 I didnt want to say, you said it.
 That was not the, not at all the world that he invested in for the first plus years of his career.
 Totally.
 Warren definitely doesnt see this yet, if ever.
 But for the moment Gates gets this.
 Certainly some other people in tech, and in Silicon Valley, and in Seattle get this, that this is the world that were moving into.
 But most of the world doesnt.
 So for Warren this is like, okay, back to business as usual.
 He is though concerned about the tech bubble that is forming, that he and so many others see.
 By this time, by the late s, The Berkshire share price had gone from about a share to a share.
 Over how many years from to?
 To, this is probably like or so.
 Six years,  x.
 Not bad.
 Yeah, not bad.
 billion market cap for Berkshire, but theyve never split the stock.
 People in this sort of, part of the tech bubble craze was like, day trading and people are now internet trading, and like eshares.
 I dont know if its eshares.
 Etrade.
 Etrade, yeah, is happening.
 People are setting up publicly traded investment trusts that mirror Berkshires equity portfolio, like heavily shadow Berkshire.
 This is so brutal.
 I mean, this is like, for the person that wanted to carefully control investment in the company.
 Someone says, oh well, if you cant buy an actual share of Berkshire, you can buy a fractional share from me, and Ill own a bunch of Berkshire underneath, and Ill be like you, own it.
 Thats Warrens absolute worst nightmare.
 I think both these things are happening.
 I think, obviously, theres demand from all this new retail investing to own Berkshire shares.
 But most people cant afford a share then or now.
 I think two things are is what youre saying, which is people are buying Berkshire shares, putting them in a trust, and then selling shares in that trust.
 The other thing people are doing is theyre just like reading every F that comes out and Q, and K.
 And buying the same portfolio?
 Buying the same securities that Berkshire is buying, and doing the same thing.
 What a hamfisted way to do it.
 Totally.
 You dont have the benefit of the insurance flow, and you dont have the Totally.
 And the lag, its going to be this thing where people feel like theyre buying Berkshire Associated, but theyre actually buying well after Berkshires or even the price of that stock.
 Way, way less.
 Warren finally comes around.
 He really, he thinks like things, okay, people are getting swindled.
 I have to find some way to put a stop to this.
 I dont want to split the stock.
 And this was a meme, at the annual meeting, every single year.
 Someone asked the question, are you going to split the stock so that more people can invest in it?
 He would always respond something, like, no, I love our current investor base.
 Why would I do anything that would change the great set of people that we already have, shareholders in this wonderful company.
 Yup.
 He comes up with a brilliant idea.
 He decides that he is going to do a stock offering for a new class of shares, what hes going to call the Baby B class of shares versus the newly rechristened Berkshire Ashares.
 And these are going to be tracking shares that are going to track of the Ashares in terms of value.
 Massively diminished voting rights.
 Hes going to sell this in a new offering that is actually openended.
 So, theres no fixed amount.
 Its not like Im offering X number of shares.
 He doesnt want a supplydemand thing to happen.
 He doesnt want basically micro economic forces to happen, and drive up the price of the Bshares.
 So hes like, heres the price, and were going to make as many of them as we need to at that price.
 As people want to buy.
 Even if you hoard them, it will benefit you at all.
 Totally.
 Which also means however much demand there is, because its an offering, Berkshire is going to get the cash.
 This is even better than float.
 You never have to get the cash back.
 Theyre raising their seriesC.
 Yeah.
 I bet Buffett would go to the math with you on thats even better than float.
 He probably would.
 I mean, he is deluding the value.
 Yes.
 As a quick aside, I think this Bshare is offering is a really good place to talk about when they are buying things with cash versus shares, sort of how they think about the two currencies, they have at their disposal, the balance sheet cash, and the shares thing issue, and dilute the company.
 Buffett notoriously likes using cash versus shares since he thinks the existing portfolio of Berkshire businesses are far better than pretty much every other business he could buy.
 So given that, why would he trade shares of these amazing businesses for something that who knows what it is.
 It may be good, but its not as good as my treasure trove that I already have here.
 So they use cash, obviously, whenever they can.
 Except when their shares have been richly valued by the market, and thus a phenomenal currency to use after it crosses a certain point.
 In when he did the Bshares offering.
 Normally, Berkshire shares trade that the Ashares trade similar between the .
 x book value of evolved Berkshires Holdings.
 Well, in this case, the moment they decided, okay, its worth it for us to dilute our shareholders, and do this new financing event, and do the B shares thing.
 It was trading at almost twice book value.
 Wow.
 It was merely an alltime high.
 He gets all the credit.
 Its almost like the Ben Thompson strategy credit thing.
 He gets all the credit for doing this but it was a huge windfall for Berkshire to do it at the moment that they did.
 They are wonderfully transparent about this as well, because they know theres going to be crazy demand for the Bshares, kind of no matter what.
 So they write all these hilarious disclaimers.
 Ill just read my favorite one.
 Mr.
 Buffett and Mr.
 Munger believe that Berkshires classA common stock is not under valued at the market price stated above.
 Neither Mr.
 Buffett nor Mr.
 Munger would currently buy Berkshire shares at that price, nor would they recommend that their friends or families do so.
 Yes.
 Its like Eric Yuan going on Bloomberg and saying, its too high.
 The price is too high, price is too high.
 Oh my gosh.
 Well, this is great.
 Of course you know what were going to transition to next.
 Lets see.
 Out of I think were talking about.
 Were now .
 are you keying off my buying something with shares?
 Yes, I am.
 Are we going insurance?
 Were going Insurance.
 Tell me about Gen Re, David.
 Lets talk Gen Re.
 Yeah.
 Warren hates it.
 Warren hated issuing stock, but hes like, stock is so overpriced.
 I said it, not him.
 Note that he didnt say its overpriced, he said its not under priced.
 Exactly exactly.
 In he made another shocking announcement.
 Berkshire is gonna buy Gen Re, one of the worlds largest reinsurers for billion.
 Remember just a few years ago it was huge news when Buffett would put .
 million into Coke or buy the rest of Geico for billion.
 That was huge.
 I think that was the biggest deal theyve done before.
 Yeah.
 This General Reinsurance purchased by far their largest acquisition ever.
 Yup.
 It is the elephant gun hunting phase of Warrens acquisition career.
 Yeah, its literally the largest deal Berkshires ever done by a factor of and he does it with all stock, not a dollar of cash goes out the door.
 He trades of Berkshires market cap for Gen Re.
 Spoiler alert, it does not go well.
 Famously, when Charlie is asked about the deal when it gets announced, Charlie is like the bluntest character as we have seen and as we will see at the end of this episode.
 Charlies response to the deal when asked about it is that Warren only called him quote, Very late in the game on this one.
 Hes just kind of like Im washing my hands off this.
 I think if theres one lesson in this series among many it is that if Charlie Munger is your business partner you should probably always call Charlie early in the game, and not late in the game, see Sullivan Brothers.
 What was the really alluring thing about buying Gen Re?
 Because it massively multiplied the amount of float at their disposal by buying.
 Yeah, yeah they got a bunch of float.
 To be honest, the alluring thing about buying Gen Re was that Warren thought that Berkshire stock was overvalued and he wanted to take advantage of this moment in time and use it to do a big acquisition.
 This is according to Alice in The Snowball, most if not all of Gen Res investments, talked about insurance companies with their float, they invest the float insecurities.
 Warren and Berkshire prefer to do that in equities.
 Most of Gen Res investments were in debt and relatively conservative bonds and the like.
 Warren is worried about equities crash coming along here because of the tech bubble, he wants to essentially dilute Berkshires Security Holdings.
 He doesnt want to sell security, because that would be a signal to the market.
 Like Warren Buffett is selling stocks.
 That might tip everything over into the crash.
 Hes like, how can I change the mix of securities that we have at Berkshire without me doing something like that?
 I can do this all stock equity deal by Gen Re and essentially get a portfolio of ish billion dollars of bonds that are going to be insulated from equity prices.
 Boy, that is some financial jiujitsu engineering right there.
 He definitely over thought this one because Gen Re sucked to be blunt.
 I will say that its funny.
 You said that I just pulled up the historical price to book ratio of Berkshire.
 I think the only times it was meaningfully above x that the stock was trading above twice book was right around  when they did the B shares and then right around .
 I think he definitely felt like those were great times to be using Berkshire stock for currency.
 We didnt cover this last time because it didnt fit with the story.
 But back in Warren made almost undoubtedly the best hire that he ever made in his career, and he makes very few hires, as we shall see.
 He hired Ajit Jain to run Berkshires Insurance Businesses.
 This dude is a monster.
 You have no idea how unbelievably great Ajit is.
 Hes an underwriting savant.
 This guy can hear a crazy story that you tell him, like what if Im going to strap this guy to this rocket and then were going to shoot it at a hurricane and you know I want insurance that bypasses the force majeure and that can help give you a price for it.
 Hes like I know exactly how to price this.
 He is a jetjackering roll reincarnate.
 Ajit, he grew up in India.
 He went to IIT in India and then he worked for IBM.
 Maybe this explains Buffets fascination with IBM.
 Ajit came out of there, its gotta be good.
 Then he goes to Harvard Business School and then he goes to McKenzie and then he joins Berkshire.
 We were talking about him like hes an insurance pricing savantthat is true.
 Theres probably never been anybody better than Ajit at pricing insurance.
 He is also hyper aggressive.
 If Ajit had decided to be a venture capitalist, he would have been like Bill Gurley times .
 Hypersmart, hyperaggressive for basically his whole career.
 I doubt this is still going on, probably at Warrens request not Ajits.
 But for decades, every night, I dont know if its every week night or every day of the week, they would do a nightly call at PM to go over the insurance portfolio and all the deals that Ajit was doing.
 Hes just a monster.
 When he joins, he takes over all of Berkshires other insurance businesses besides Geico to start.
 Then he starts a new reinterred business within Berkshire, like himself.
 This is the great entrepreneurial story within Berkshire.
 Famously, he takes out an ad in Business Insurance Magazine full page ad when he starts this saying we are looking for more, more casualty risks where the premium exceeds million.
 This is the insurance business.
 This is crazy.
 Nobody does this.
 So basically hes saying like I will insure things that other people wont insure because Im more confident in my ability to price these weird, crazy, expensive policies, yes.
 And the value of the premium for the policy, I want everything.
 I want the craziest highest value premiums in the world that other insurers like a Gen Re and Swiss Re and the like would never do.
 Theyre just like, thats just way too much money at risk.
 Right and they are factories.
 Theyre looking to identify the same thing over and over and over again.
 These actually have a very fun name too, these are called super catssuper catastrophic insurance policies.
 Super cat is a really cool name for a pretty boring thing.
 Totally.
 I think the story goes that after , where Gen Re would take huge losses on and Berkshire and Ajit would be fine.
 But after , Ajit starts going around the world writing terrorism insurance policies left and right.
 Everybody wants them now, everybodys scared.
 Hes like, oh great.
 This is actually not that risky.
 Im going to make a killing on this superhigh premium tens of millions of dollar policies.
 The crazy thing is that Gen Re was basically mismanaged and they had these policies written in that had holes in them that they shouldnt have.
 Where they took on risk that they basically werent being paid for and then just got destroyed.
 Yes.
 Heres what happens.
 The obvious thing to do in  when they buy Gen Re would be to just give Gen Re to Ajit.
 Ajit is the greatest of all time, give him more.
 Instead, Buffet runs the White Knight AcquirerPlaybook even though he has no reason to now.
 You keep running your own business.
 Tells management, even though theyre not the founders of the company.
 Hes like, we love you, you keep running your own business, you do what you do.
 Im going to be, this is quote from Warren, Strictly hands off.
 Yikes.
 Immediately after Berkshire buys Gen Re, news that Gen Re is a counterparty on a massive insurance fraud scheme called Unit Cover that I believe was residential insurance.
 They immediately hit a million underwriting loss.
 This is within the first week after the approach survives the company.
 Remember Buffets rule number one, which is never lose money.
 Rule number two is your rule number one.
 First week on the job you lost million.
 Great.
 Then they do a bunch of bad deals insuring Hollywood box office receipts for movies that lose them.
 I think about another billion dollars, its rough.
 Then happens, they lose all told close to another two billion dollars in .
 And then, finally, and probably the worst offense, given the Salomon history in the early s, so a couple of years after the acquisition, Gen Re gets involved in a major accounting scandal with AIG propping up AIGs balanced sheet.
 Nobody ended up going to jail on this one but basically, massively hurt Gen Res reputation and brought the regulators all over them.
 This is the one thing Warren wants less than anything.
 Eventually, Warren would oust the old management, fire them, and bring in Joe Brandon and Tad Montross to fix it.
 They do a good job.
 And then eventually Warren does hand the whole thing over to Ajit in .
 Ajit is now running Gen Re in addition to everything else.
 Wild saga here.
 What a mess.
 What a mess.
 Before we move on and while we are talking insurance, listeners, you know, its time to talk about Vouch.
 I have a new story to tell you all this time around.
 And I recently received this email from a founder, describing their experience with a legacy insurance company to provide insurance for their startup.
 Now, Ill read this word for word.
 I am completely spent, I cant take it anymore.
 The process with our insurance company and my renewals has blown my mind with the paper forms, scanning mailed invoices to an office that I am not in daily, etc.
, there has to be a better way that does not consume more of my time than the price of the policy itself.
 Whatever I have spent on premiums, Ill give x this year on administrative cost.
 Wow, is former Gen Re management running this?
 Crazy, right?
 I got this and I was just like Dude, you got to get Vouch.
 How fast can I respond to check out Vouch?
 Vouch is the literal exact opposite of this.
 As you know, from previous episodes they provide business insurance for startups, they are the company that got business insurance for us to Acquired in honestly, less than minutes.
 That it says in the copy they sent over, I should have timed it.
 My recollection is it was literally under minutes, website, full digital experience, awesome.
 Night and day, literally does not begin to describe Vouch versus other incumbents.
 It is truly unbelievable.
 The step function better that they have been able to achieve in this industry.
 You know this by now, theyre backed by some of the best investors including Ribbit, YC, SVD and Index.
 Acquired listeners, you all get an extra off your coverages which for business insurance can be a meaningful amount.
 You can click the link in the show notes or go to vouch.
usacquired to learn more.
 What a great business.
 Truly.
 All right, David take us on from Gen Re.
 Where else are we going?
 All right, we cant move on fast enough.
 Before the tech bubble pops, he does one more surprising to outside watchers move which is in .
 He buys a utility company.
 Berkshire buying a utility company.
 This is what Warren has come to.
 The link company that provides you electricity.
 He buys Mid American Energy Holdings and people want to know why is Warren buying a utility?
 Alice writes in the snow ball, Warren was already being ridiculed for his refusal to buy technology stocks.
 Now, he had bought the light company, how dull.
 The energy business ends up being fine for Berkshire.
 Its another fine investment.
 It doesnt lose money, theyre fine.
 It does come though with two managers that Warren seems to greatly admire.
 By the way, we talked about this in the preshow but we havent yet talked about it in the episodes.
 You know how you see Berkshire Hathaway real estate agents all over the place?
 Oh yeah.
 That came with MidAmerican Energy Holdings.
 They also had a real estate brokerage.
 So weird.
 How does that work?
 My understanding of the electric company is that its like a public utility.
 Its market by market then that some of them must be private companies.
 Yeah, I dont know exactly.
 Obviously, there are lots of separate utilities in different geographies all across the country.
 Yeah, somehow there are real estate brokerages in there as well.
 There is the CEO of the company, one David Sokol and the number two.
 Remember that name.
 Yeah, remember that name.
 His number two, a guy named Greg Abel.
 You need to remember that name.
 Future CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.
 Yeah, thats how they come into the company, you hear much more about them later.
 Finally, all this tech novel stuff comes to a head in the annual meeting where Warren and Charlie are just getting pummeled by questions from shareholders on stage in the arena.
 Asking what on earth they are doing, why do they not own technology stocks?
 Everyone else is getting these five xs in a year.
 What are you doing here?
 Trying to make me ?
 Youre making a poor.
 Warren says, I dont want to speculate about hightech.
 And then of course he goes on to speculate and he compares the whole thing to a Ponzi scheme.
 And then Charlie jumps in, this is my favorite.
 This might be my favorite Charlie moment of all time.
 He jumps in and he says, The reason we use the phrase wretched excess is because it produces wretched consequences, its irrational.
 If you mix raisins with turds, theyre still turds.
 Alltime great movie quote.
 I dont know if there is a video of this.
 If there is, I havent seen it.
 But I can just imagine, like the entire Arena, just being like, shocks, like did Charlie Monger just say turds?
 What?
 I think Alice actually just says that live.
 It was noble.
 But if you think about what each of them is saying, its telling and its actually quite different.
 Warren is saying, I dont understand this stuff.
 I refuse to engage.
 Its a Ponzi scheme.
 Charlie is saying something different.
 He gets that there are reasons in tech stocks like Microsoft and the like.
 They are the real companies there.
 But there are also turds and Microsoft may be doing great.
 But if, and when this whole tech novel thing pops and it will, the splatter from the turds is going to get all over your raisins too and drag it down.
 When Warren says that I dont understand this thing, its a Ponzi scheme.
 He is referring to the crazy multiples that people are paying on top of revenue.
 Because of course, profits dont exist much like today.
 But lets even walk a few more levels.
 Often revenues dont exist for companies that are going public.
 Which like that you only see in space or like battery technologies or something now.
 But then even further, some of these companies are selling products but they have upside down unit economics.
 Theyre not even gross profit positive.
 You could understand why you would look over to Charlie and have him saying theres turds in here, because truly there were.
 Its crazy some of that stuff is going public.
 Then you look over to Warren and he understands all the financial infrastructure around it.
 That the banks are incentivized to do it, that they earlier shareholders are incentivized to get marked up and get it public and then sell to get it off their books.
 There was a Ponzi scheme like things going on because there was so much rampant speculation about raisins and turds.
 Actually, I was curious about this.
 I did some analysis.
 This is flash forwarding, maybe too much, but yes at the absolute height of the tech bubble when this shareholder meeting is happening.
 If you were to put a dollar into Berkshire Hathaway stock, if you could buy a fraction of a share of DA for a dollar, that dollar even today in May so years later, invested in Berkshire would outperform the NASDAQ, it would definitely outperform the SMP, and it would vary slightly outperform Microsoft.
 If you had invested in Microsoft in the first half of and held it to today and youve invested a dollar in Berkshire, you would be doing better in Berkshire than Microsoft.
 Charlies right, the splatter from the turds is going to get all over the raisins, including Microsoft.
 But if you had invested a dollar in Microsoft versus Berkshire at almost literally any other point in time, either before in like  when the famous Sun Valley panel happened with Coke and ham sandwich and Bill Gates, Microsoft would be crushing Berkshire if you would put dollars in at that point in time.
 Totally fascinating.
 If you were to invest a dollar in each just a year later in you would still be doing better on Microsoft and then of course the farther you go along.
 Obviously any time since.
 Anytime since youre going to be doing much better.
 Does this dynamic play out earlier too?
 When did it IPO, in  or  somewhere in there?
 Somewhere.
 Theyre obviously putting a dollar into Microsoft early.
 In the early days.
 Right.
 Man, its funny that the dynamic exist twice where if youre super early at Microsoft and of course its going to multiply it and say number of times to now but the runup in the last five years has also been so crazy that if you invested any time after the dot com recovery which only really was like a year.
 Then yeah, its going to outperform Berkshire.
 Charlie is right here like yes.
 In that exact moment.
 The bubble popping is going to drag everything that is good down with it.
 But were almost really at the point where it doesnt even matter anymore if you had invested at the top of the market in the tech bubble, youd still be doing better than Berkshire, except for like a very narrow window of time.
 Yeah, another point that theyre both making here is that theres a lot of innovation going on.
 For sure.
 You look around, theres for sure all these incredible things going on with the Internet but the underlying stuff thats going on with Microsoft and the hardware makers, theyre always like, oh, the whole ecosystem, theres a dramatic amount of innovation.
 The reason that they dont invest and this comes out in a Fortune article that Warren writes sort of warning about the dot com bubble.
 Of course, he doesnt say the bubble is going to burst, he doesnt say hes calling a top, but he sort of beats around a little bit and says hes not interested in buying right now.
 I think its sort of the way he positions it.
 He talks about how in the early days of making cars there were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of car manufacturers, lots and lots of innovation going on.
 Today, there are only a few.
 Its this analogy at the annual meeting this year too, I think, right?
 Yup.
 Just because there is innovation, sure, thats great for the innovator in the short term but for the investor, for the shareholder, that doesnt mean youre going to be able to capture value.
 You have to be able to create a mote.
 You have to be able to figure out what about the business creates that durable, competitive advantage so all the prophets dont get arbitraged away.
 I think he actually finishes the article citing the most perfect example of arbitraging profits away by over a hundred year period going from pure innovation to sheer commodity, which is the airline industry.
 He highlights, I dont think this is exactly true anymore, but it was true at the point in  when he wrote it that the sum total if you add up all the profits and subtract all the losses from the whole airline industry since the inception of airlines, it was a loss.
 Yeah.
 And then he says, this is sort of gruesome, but I think he ends the article right with saying that hed like to think that if he could go back in time to was in and Kitty Hawk, when the Wright brothers flew that he would do capitalists a favor and shoot them down.
 Yup.
 Which is an insane way to put it, but the point that hes making is just so stark and Im sure its not something I had really thought about and its certainly not something that was on peoples minds in  which is the proliferation of innovation does not necessarily imply that there is value to be captured in a durable way by a single firm.
 Yup, not necessarily.
 It also doesnt necessarily imply that it wont be and of course, Warren is hugely wrong about technology and the internet on this front.
 Remember what Warren says here about the airlines and what must be going on in his mind later in life, when he buys every airline stock in the industry, twice.
 For the moment though, tech bubble bursts, as we all know Warren and hes still top of his game, Oracle Omaha, everybodys raining praise on him.
 He saw it all come in, Ill trip, the early s are more greatness for Warren, but then in July Susie passed away.
 This is devastating to Warren even though they havent actually lived together for like years at this point.
 He still loves her hugely and depends on her.
 Theyre technically married, right?
 Even though they live Theyre still technically married, even though they dont live together.
 Thousand miles away.
 She lives in San Francisco.
 He lives in Omaha.
 Like we said last night, we were not going to cover it on not Acquired here, but his personal life is complicated.
 I do not think at all that Warren is or was ever a womanizer.
 But it is true that he had many women in his life and I think it was all aboveboard.
 Its all in The Snowball.
 You can go read about it.
 But hes devastated when Susie passes away.
 Outside of his personal grief though, which is acute, the most pressing issue is whats going to happen to the Buffett fortune in Berkshire because in typical Warren fashion until this point in his life, he never thought about it.
 He always assumed that Susie was going to outlive him and the plan for the now billion plus of net worth that the Buffett family has, the plan was always that after Warren would die, Susie would set up a foundation there.
 She already had the Susan Buffett Foundation and give it all away.
 That was the plan.
 But obviously thats not going to happen.
 Warren has been thinking about the conundrum of what to do with his wealth since long before he was wealthy.
 In his teenage years, he was already thinking about when Im really rich, what do I do with it all?
 He is immensely frustrated by any attempt that he has at philanthropy, which has to be, why he basically says, thats a Susie problem.
 Shell figure it out and set it up when Im done.
 His frustrations largely come from the fact that he does have things that he really cares about and that he cares about promoting.
 I think hes very worried about an impending human societal problem of overpopulation.
 Which interestingly enough didnt end up happening that the world has sort of slowed and I believe maybe even stopped the global population growth.
 He was very worried about not only when you use up all the energy on earth, but are we going to use up all the food and will famine be an issue.
 He had tried to give to various charities over the years.
 But he was so obsessed with performance and metrics, and that kind of money was a scoreboard that when he would give it, and he couldnt sort of understand the investment return.
 He wasnt privy to the investment return, he couldnt choose the investment manager that it really wasnt used to compound in the way that he was used to his investments compounding in a way that you could sort of see a dollar return on.
 It was just immensely frustrating and hed really throwing his hands up in the air and kind of just donated here and there, but had a big fortune.
 Yup.
 I think as we called in part one, there is this element of his psychology where hes curious about the scoreboard.
 He just wants the money to have as big a number as possible.
 He doesnt want to buy stuff, giving it away like surely eventually, hell do that.
 He just wants to get the number as high as possible by the day he dies.
 Thats what he cares about.
 Which is, of course, competing with the fact that he wants people to like him.
 Not only does he want to be very wealthy, he wants the worlds adoration.
 He throws himself a festival once a year for everyone to fly in and visit.
 Nowhere in Securities Law does it say that your shareholder meeting must be like.
 This is a Warren Buffett creation to bring this upon himself.
 He wants to be a beloved figure, and teacher, on top of being the wealthiest person on earth.
 You could see how those things could come ahead.
 You could accuse me of not being innovative in his investment philosophies.
 Never accuse him of not being innovative in finding ways to get what he wants.
 After Susie dies, the wheels start turning.
 He invites Bill Gates to join the Berkshire board.
 Up into this point, the board was basically his family and close business associates that he actually worked with like Charlie, Tom Murphy, Ron Paulson from MTO, Dan Kiyo is on the board, and David Gadisman from New York back in the days.
 Even though Gates is a close friend, I think hes the first real outsider who Warrens never done actual business with that joins the board.
 Something is afoot here.
 And then we all find out probably the reason why this is happening.
 In Warren made what was almost certainly the biggest decision and perhaps most impactful decision in philanthropic history and I totally remember when this happened.
 He calls a press conference and he announces that he is going to give away of his Berkshire stock which is worth billion at the time and of it is going to go to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for them to manage.
 And the other is going to go to his childrens foundations and the Susan Buffett Foundation.
 This is crazy.
 Theres no Warren Buffett Foundation, hes not going to give the money away.
 Hes not going to make any of these decisions.
 He off loads all of it to the Gates Foundation.
 Which really is remarkable.
 Hes like, boy, its really hard to give money away.
 I dont know the first thing about her.
 Theres a lot of infrastructure required to do this.
 Actually, that guys already built the infrastructure, and I very much trust him.
 This is what is so amazing.
 This is like a winwinwin for Warren.
 Everybody is like, Warren, you are the most amazing, most generous person.
 This is the biggest gift in history.
 You have done such an amazing thing for humanity.
 This of course leads to the giving pledge that the Gates is an end and Warren trade in .
 It becomes like the coolest thing in the world for billionaires to give their money away.
 Warren is setting a status symbol here.
 Meanwhile, Warren is getting exactly what he wants.
 He never has to deal with any of this.
 The one drawback for him has to be the fact that the Gates Foundation Legacy will long outlive Microsofts Legacy in terms of the way that people remember Bill and Melinda.
 Microsoft will still be a successful company years from now, but I dont think people will remember it as Bill Gates legacy.
 The foundation, absolutely.
 Hes very concerned with his ego.
 It had to be a big tradeoff to not have a gigantic endowment with his name on it.
 Yeah, I get it.
 Who knows how much he planned this out, but him doing this and then creating the giving pledge and driving all of the philanthropy that that does by making it like the ultimate status symbol to give your money away.
 Should have called it the Buffett Giving Blood.
 Totally.
 Thats going to go down in history as the number of billions, tens, hundreds, God knows how many billions are going to be given away because of this.
 Its pretty cool.
 It is pretty cool.
 Its amazing, its wonderful, its great for society.
 Warren must be so pleased with himself with this.
 That all happens in the mid to late s.
 Which is an interesting turning point for Berkshire Hathaways strategy.
 If you think about this period of to maybe extended to theyre going after buying these good businesses where the operators still care about the businesses after they sell them.
 Thats the secret to success.
 You leave the management in place except for decision and maybe even MidAmerican Energy.
 was a good manager.
 Hes just a little too good, as well see.
 They could do this thing where they would under pay versus private equity.
 They were the better option for these companies that were anywhere from the hundreds of millions to low billions in value.
 But it does get to the point pretty quickly with just the cash on hand, that the amount of money they need to deploy just got too large, and theres not enough furniture stores and familyowned jewelry chains in America to go by.
 This is real.
 One thing that becomes clear is that Warren keeps harping on, were so big, its hard to move the needle.
 Thats really true.
 He has been forecasting this for years.
 Its really true at this point.
 The law of gravity tying Berkshire to the SP is, theres a lot of gravity.
 The giving pledge, its like when Warren makes his major gift to the Gates Foundation.
 But its not until that they all launch the giving pledge.
 Why did it take so long?
 I assume it took so long because not too many people wanted to give away a lot of money in the intervening years between and because a little thing called the financial crisis happened.
 Dun dun dun.
 As discussed so many times on this show, the beginnings of Airbnb, Uber, and cryptocurrency on and on and on.
 Whats that article embedded into the Genesis block of Bitcoin?
 Yes, it was Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks which allegedly is mocking the fractional reserve banking system.
 But yes it is a very deep reference in the midst of the financial crisis.
 Indeed, indeed.
 Heres Warren and then Charlie too, hes freshly unencumbered by the weight of having to deal with his wealth.
 Hes back in the saddle.
 Hes not literally unretired, but like figuratively unretired again for the third time, ready to go to work.
 And he has seen this movie before.
 They were there, they were leading players in the dress rehearsal of Salomon and early s.
 All right, I think we know what to do here.
 The whole thing takes off.
 I remember this so well, in March of when Bear Stearns, the story of an investment bank failed, just like Salomon, the problem at Bear was that they failed because they had inhouse hedge funds that were mortgagebacked security hedge funds and those had huge losses.
 That wasnt why it failed.
 It failed because Bears counterparties stopped trusting their paper and stopped being willing to trade with them.
 Like we saw a Salomon, a huge amount of their capital base turns over overnight because youre settling trades and your counterpart is on those trades.
 If their counterparties no longer trust that youre good for the money, theyre going to stop trading forward to you and then the vicious cycle comes to a screeching halt.
 Thats what happened with Bear.
 During the course of one week in March from March th which was Monday to the end of the week, which would have been, what?
 I guess the th, the Friday.
 Bear Stearns stock had started the week trading at a share and by Friday theyre toast.
 Theyre bankrupt.
 Over the weekend, the FED engineered an asset sale to JP Morgan for a share.
 The old Bear Stearns entity is completely bankrupt, the good assets, the nontoxic assets get put into an LLC that the government creates and JP Morgan buys it for a share backstopped by government money.
 If anything goes wrong, JP Morgan is not on the hook.
 Its bad, never seen anything like that.
 Berkshire, of course, I dont know if they got a call, I assume Warren probably got a call from somebody about Bear Stearns that week, decided not to save them or bail them out.
 But Berkshire has billion of cash sitting on its books at this point which today seems kind of quaint compared to Apple and Microsoft and the like.
 But you know, back then nobody else had that kind of cash anywhere.
 The only people who have that are governments.
 Right.
 I have to assume the most valuable company in the world at that point probably wasnt an oil company and probably was in the neighborhood of billion.
 Yeah.
 But probably didnt keep a lot of cash on their books because you know youre an oil and fuel operating company, you got all tied up in capital.
 Oh, for sure but just making the point that things like that are almost an order of magnitude smaller at the largest company in the world.
 Totally, both things.
 The companies are smaller and nobody is piling up cash like internet companies are today, except for Berkshire.
 They have all this cash.
 Its a great climate to invest in, but one of the lessons that I think Warren and Charlie took away from the Salomon debacle was you dont necessarily want to be like the major primary equity holder during the crisis.
 In case things really go, right?
 You dont want to be that guy thats called it before the congress.
 You really dont.
 Instead of making a lot of equity investments at this time, they decide instead to pursue a different strategy.
 Theyre going to make debt and preferred equity fixed income investments in companies that need capital.
 Can you simplify that for us?
 Is it like, hey were to loan you money and if we want to do then we might exercise some warrants?
 Exactly, and were going to loan you money out of a very high interest rate.
 Yeah, maybe well make equity type returns, but were going to have A whole bunch of downside protection.
 A whole bunch of downside protection and some warrant upside.
 And we dont have governance over the company.
 And youre not going to call us in front of congress.
 The first of these that they did was in April of right after the Bear blow up.
 Mars, the candy company, diversified conglomerate, one of the largest private companies in the world, announces that it is acquiring Wrigley, the chewing gum candy manufacturer for billion.
 But its kind of hard to get financing from banks right now.
 Thats a lot of gum.
 Thats a lot of gum.
 I dont know what else Wrigley, they won against the Cubs.
 I was going to say, theres no way theres even billion of gum a year purchased.
 Hey, Warren started by selling gum, buying in bulk, and breaking up the packs.
 Right, keep talking.
 Im looking up what else Wrigley does.
 Mars is going to put billion of equity for the deal.
 Goldman and JP Morgan are going to do a little over five and a half billion dollars of debt but they still have .
 billion holding they need to fill.
 In steps Warren and Berkshire.
 They invest .
 billion to fund this deal of Mars, not Berkshire, buying Wrigley and they do it with .
 billion of debt that Mars buys from Berkshire with an .
 interest rate of the debt.
 Thats unreal!
 Mars is a great, very stable company.
 This must really be their only option.
 I remember seeing in the last couple months that Amazon or Apple or somebody priced a debt offering recently at something absurd like .
 interest rate or something like that.
 Yeah.
 Times are very different and there are lots of options available for corporations.
 Lots of options available for capital.
 .
 interest rate, that is unreal.
 The other billion Berkshire Investments Preferred Equity with interest rate that gets more in coverage on it all in the end up realizing a IRR on this deal.
 Which is pretty good because theres not a lot of risk here.
 Now, as Warren would say, people chew a lot of gum in the past and chew a lot of gum in the future.
 No, Warren.
 David it really is pretty much all gum.
 This is crazy.
 You are at least a majority.
 In they did over billion in revenue and they own JC Fruits, Pyramid, Doublemint, Big Red, Extra, Orbit.
 Theres some other candies.
 They own all the gum brands out there.
 They do.
 Yeah, exactly.
 There are some candies too.
 But this may have been after the combination with Mars but now under the Wrigley subsidiaries, theres Skittles, Starburst Altoids, Gummy Savers, Lifesavers that sort of stuff too.
 Im having a heart attack just hearing all these things.
 But yes, as I was saying theres a huge arbitrage here.
 Because I think this is also what Warren and Charlie realize, the government is bringing the bazookas out.
 Theyre slashing interest rates, theyre throwing money into this.
 Everything that we just saw them do during COVID, they first did during the financial crisis.
 Is this the start of quantitative easing?
 This is like the bazooka of quantitative easing.
 Youve got this crazy situation where the government is making capital available for free, basically, and Berkshire can come into these situations and make capital available in fixed income guaranteed return with percent yields.
 Why is that?
 Is it just like that theres no way to get the fear of the Mars Corporation, theres no way to get your hands on that free money?
 I think in this case, yes.
 I think theres also a reputational element to this too, really.
 If people are worried, especially in the financial sector which well get to in a minute, people are worried about counterparty risk, trust and effective runs on the bank of the investment bank sense.
 Well, bringing Berkshire and Warren is going to do a lot to shore up trust here.
 And I guess another way of saying to get your hands on the money from cheap money from the government, thats a bailout.
 Yeah, thats a bailout.
 You dont want to be the company that got a government bailout when others didnt.
 And probably doesnt help with trust too much.
 Thats in April and then Berkshire is fairly quiet for the next few months.
 I remember these few months between March and September are like the eye of the hurricane.
 Everybodys like, its got everything, going to be okay here.
 Its a weird moment but then of course September rolls around in .
 Its funny because you have this memory of the spring.
 This was after my freshman year of college, which was like spring quarter.
 I was completely oblivious.
 I was getting ready to go do my first internship at Cisco.
 I just remember preparing for it and knowing.
 And there was not a concern in my mind that, like maybe my internship will get cancelled, or maybe these companies will go under.
 I do, however, remember what youre about to tell, like the last few weeks of my internship, just watching like being glued to the news and refreshing every day come September.
 Thats so funny.
 Even though were so close in age, we had such different experiences just like me being out of college and the workforce.
 Yup.
 And sector.
 Im just not that convinced that if you were outside of finance or if you were in tech at that point, that you would have seen it that early.
 You wouldve heard the news about Bear Stearns, but it wouldnt be the sort of daily obsession.
 Yeah, interesting.
 Until the fall.
 Until the fall.
 The fall was just the nuclear bomb going off.
 September of course, were talking about Lehman.
 Here is a fun story.
 This story is great.
 On Lehman weekend, Warren is, of course, on vacation.
 I think hes in Canada, with Astrid, his then wife.
 I think they were married at that point.
 Certainly a partner, they live together in Omaha.
 Yup.
 He gets a call about Lehman.
 Rumors have been circling that Lehman was in trouble and parties were starting to not trust them and the like.
 Warren is about to go see a show, like some sort of performance in the theater.
 He says, All right, well, I got to go see this show.
 Send me a fax to the hotel that Im staying at, with the details of exactly whats going on.
 Exactly what you want me to do.
 Send me a fax.
 So great.
 Hes just doing it on Blackberry.
 And he says this to Lehman Brothers?
 I dont know if it was a banker who was calling.
 I assumed it was.
 But it was about helping out Lehman Brothers.
 Yeah, he knows Dick Fuld, who is the CEO of Lehman.
 Its about bailing out Lehman.
 Because Lehmans getting worried that the feds might not bail them out of here.
 This might be the end.
 After the show, Warren gets back to the hotel, theres no fax.
 Hes like they just didnt want me that bad.
 Must be good.
 A year later, in summer .
 Hes at Sun Valley, of course, with little Susie and she looks at his phone.
 He has like a flip phone and she says, Dad, theres a text message on your phone.
 No way.
 Yes, yes, yes.
 You have got to be kidding me.
 Hes like, whats a text message?
 And its from Lehman, and apparently like wires got crossed, it was asking for maybe like the fax number for the hotel and stuff.
 Like, what hotel are you staying at or something.
 Oh my God.
 Isnt that amazing?
 How Warren Buffett could have saved the Lehman Brothers if he was a little more techsavvy.
 Totally.
 Its a funny story.
 Of course though, theres more to it.
 Warren could have gotten ahold of them if everybody really wanted it.
 Turns out the actual story is I think that did really happen.
 Warren tells in a video, I think it might be a Wall Street Journal video, kind of a retrospective about the crisis.
 In March, right after the Bear collapse, Dick Fuld had called Warren about a capital injection then and Warren had studied it then.
 It isnt a Wall Street Journal video because this is a great moment.
 He goes into his office, he brings out the printed out Lehman Brothers K from that he had studied in March with all of his handwritten notes all over it.
 Amazing.
 He was thinking about it.
 He was thinking about it.
 He went to Salomon Brothers once he could have done it again.
 He was thinking about it, but he decided there was too much risk and maybe hes probably a little shy from Salomon Brothers.
 He didnt invest in March.
 I think he said he wasnt going to do it again anyway in September.
 On September th, of course, famously Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, goes under.
 Of course everybody remembers Lehman and talks about Lehman.
 People forget that AIG also had a crisis that weekend, the FED ultimately did bail out AIG and not Lehman.
 Warren got a call about AIG too.
 He passed on AIG.
 He did not invest in those financial firms in September .
 However, he did get two other calls that he was slightly more receptive to, specifically Goldman Sachs and GE.
 He wouldnt think of GE as a financial firm, but they had GE Capital which is a large, very active financial player and they were in trouble.
 Did you know that GEs consumerfacing savings bank was sold to Goldman Sachs?
 This is like maybe years ago and Goldman Sachs rebranded in a sloppy rebranch kind of a quick one, GS Bank.
 And it sat as GS bank for like two or three years and then that became the underpinnings of Marcus.
 No way.
 I did not know that.
 Was originally a GE financial product.
 No way.
 They were both Warren Buffett bailouts.
 sweep ups.
 sweep ups.
 The very next week after the Lehman bankruptcy, Goldman must have called probably during that weekend too or shortly thereafter.
 Berkshire invests billion for preferred equity in Goldman with a annual dividend.
 Essentially its like debt.
 Its not preferred equity, like preferred equity that you would get investing in a startup at some more debtlike instrument.
 coupon to Salomon, coupon I think was only .
 Man, this is worse than Goldman.
 With a call option for Goldman to call the preferred equity back for .
 billion plus Berkshire got another billion of common stock warrants at a strike price of a share.
 They got renegotiated I think once with Goldman but became quite valuable.
 Of course they did, its Goldman.
 All told on that deal, Berkshire ends up making about billion so they get about billion back on million that they invested.
 Theyre pretty good for a fixed income.
 And that happens within two years.
 How long did that last?
 Did they end up completely out of Goldman shortly thereafter?
 I think they held equity that they exercised from the warrants for a while but they didnt end up making too much more than a billion dollar system.
 Good deal.
 GE went slightly less well the week after Goldman on October st, Berkshire invested billion dollars in GE for basically the same deal.
 coupon, Warren divides billion of common stock at a share.
 Unfortunately, unlike Goldman who stock as of today is treating at per share versus the strike price that Berkshire got.
 GE, the strike price was .
.
 GE did very briefly trade above that mark in but its share price today is .
 Not so good.
 That was not the last deal that Berkshire would do with GE.
 Do you know about the thing?
 Oh no, I dont.
 They bought some rail cars from GE which I think is now viewed as sort of a mistake in retrospect.
 Interesting, like actual rail cars are a real curve manufacturing business.
 I think actual rail cars.
 It was like a fleet managed by GE as others, like a business umbrella associated with it.
 The subsidiary of Berkshire was Marmon Holdings Inc.
 and they acquired these assets.
 Its all the GE real car services fleet.
 Boom.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 I think for a billion dollars.
 Wow, small world.
 All told, in during the crisis, Berkshire would deploy about billion of the billion of cash that it had on hand.
 The .
 billion into Wrigley, billion into Goldman, billion into GE and .
 billion to Swiss Re, Gen Res major competitor, which was odd.
 That was in the coupon rate, not bad.
 This is my personal favorite, million loan to Harley Davidson at a interest rate.
 million to Tiffanys at and million into Sealed Air at .
 I dont know what that was.
 Was that an airline or air manufacturer or something?
 I mean honestly, since  when they bought the second half of Geico, this is probably one of the top two moves.
 The shopping spree that they do in the fallout and buying Apple which Im sure well talk about next.
 We will get to that.
 I mean truly, what else has been this big win in the last years?
 Nothing.
 Just in terms of capital deployment, this is the most capital that Berkshire has deployed since if you could call the Gen Re deal capital deployment even though it was all with stock.
 But this is legitimately a very impressive move.
 I mean this is a classic Buffett, Im going to wait until prices are rational again.
 Im going to do all my research.
 Im going to be so prepared that when the moment presents itself, I can act in mere minutes and that he did.
 Now, heres some interesting stuff about this, all of these deals, the billion deployed in actually the net returns at the end of the day that Berkshire gets back from that capital turns out to be about billion.
 You are right Ben, but from the actual investing, thats good.
 He didnt lose money on any of the stuff during like rule number one, dont lose money.
 This is all fixed income.
 Right.
 If this were a venture fund, youd say, for the vintage, its top .
 Right, exactly.
 Good, but this is not amazing.
 But theres a quota to this.
 What did you say, billion deployed to get billion back?
 billion deployed to get billion back.
 Over what time period?
 Probably all told, five years, maybe less.
 Pretty good, but Warren gets one last bite at the apple, not that Apple, the financial crisis apple in which dwarfs all of this, which is amazing.
 I thought that this happened in but no, it was in Bank of America.
 Yeah, how have we not talked about them yet?
 It was not .
 It was .
 Bank of America gets caught up in thatremember the Euro debt crisis that happened in ?
 Everybody was like, financial crisis again.
 At least in the US, it ended up not being a big thing.
 I dont know how Bank of America got caught up in this but they did.
 Berkshire stepped in, did the playbook billion of preferred equity with a coupon on it.
 Not as much as the that they got from Goldman, but they got Warren coverage to buy billion of common stock in which Bank of America had a .
 strike price.
 Today, Bank of America is trading at a stock price.
 Its a cool X.
 Cool X.
 Are they still B of A shareholders?
 Yup.
 Still B of A shareholders.
 They, all in to date, Berkshire has made about billion in profits on the B of A deal.
 Way more than the billion that they made from everything else during the financial crisis combined.
 I think significantly more than any other investment that Warren made in his entire career up to that point.
 It has to be.
 I mean theyre playing with so many bigger dollars at this point that, okay lets call these three great movies then.
 Your pretty good ones from the financial crisis, your buying of Apple and of course then the B of A one.
 Theres no way that hes done anything more better than this on an absolute dollar magnitude to this point.
 Im sure of the return on invested capital, for sure.
 B of A deal is a grand slam.
 A very important grand slam because we mentioned Wells Fargo.
 Right around this time, Wells Fargo is literally driving into the ditch with all of their scandals.
 Berkshire started buying Wells Fargo in .
 I dont think they ultimately lost money on it.
 They had big gains and then those gains evaporated.
 Right.
 You start buying Bitcoin around and yet you keep buying all the way up through then youre probably about break even.
 It feels like that.
 Yup, interesting.
 Warren is now in his s at this point.
 Yeah, years ago he got the question when are you going to retire?
 To which she always responds, about five years after Im dead.
 Five years after I die.
 Yup, thats his line.
 To be frank, this is his last hurrah.
 If you include B of A, which was a grand slam great investment, this is it.
 Hes done after this in practice although he doesnt know it.
 Starting in right after the financial crisis, thats when they changed the format of the annual meetings where its no longer people approaching the microphone.
 Its Becky Quick and the journalists asking questions and moderating.
 He starts getting hammered internally, hes like, what is the succession plan?
 What are you doing?
 You are years old.
 How many more of these wild rides can you go on?
 He gives his trademark evasive answers.
 He says that the most important qualification for his successor as CEO is running a large operating business experience doing that.
 Because Warren has so much experience running a large operating business.
 But the one part of the plan that does make a ton of sense is that he says hes going to split up his job into the CEO business side thats going to be handled separately from the investing side which will be run by one or more chief investment officers after he is no longer in charge.
 To put a finer point on that, theres someone who is going to manage the equities portfolio, the stocks that they own where they dont own the business and then the stuff that they actually do own .
 Yup.
 This is something that theyve actually been laying the groundwork for a long time.
 I vaguely remember this but going back and studying this, this is amazing.
 All the way back in in the annual report, Warren and Charlie had been talking about this.
 They come up with this idea, what if we just put an open call for candidates in the annual report?
 No way.
 Yeah.
 In the annual report, he introduced this idea, Warren writes, I intend to hire a younger man or woman with the potential to manage a very large portfolio who we hope will succeed me as Berkshires chief investment officer when the need for someone to do that arises.
 This is for the equities portfolio?
 This is for the equities portfolio.
 As part of the selection process, we may in fact take on several candidates.
 This is going on.
 I think shareholders knew this but people had forgotten by .
 That was three years ago.
 The financial crisis happened.
 Theres no progress.
 Nobodys been hired.
 Finally in they made a hire.
 A surprising hire, yearold Todd Combs.
 A completely and totally unknown manager of a small hedge fund based in Connecticut called Castle Point Capital.
 Todd had started his career working for the state of Floridas bank regulator and then gone on to work at Progressive Insurance, Geicos big competitor before becoming hedge fund manager.
 Heres the thing, Todd is great.
 This was a good hire but he ran Castle Point, his hedge fund for five years.
 During which time, he amassed cumulative returns of not annual, not IRR, total.
 How long had he been investing?
 Five years.
 This is not like an incredibly distinguished track record here.
 Buffett did almost that well every year for years in the Buffett partnerships.
 Yes.
 Everybodys a little puzzled and the plot thickens a little more.
 I think Todds hiring was announced in August or September, I want to say, sometime towards the latter part of the year.
 In July, The Wall Street Journal ran a front page piece saying that the search for Warren Buffetts successor was almost done.
 They had the candidate.
 They knew who it was.
 David, when you sent me this article, I about lost it.
 This is crazy.
 I had never heard of this.
 Me neither.
 I cant believe I didnt see this when it happened.
 Unbelievably, the chosen candidate that The Wall Street Journal reported on was Li Lu who has an amazing story himself.
 He grew up in China, he was part of the Tiananmen Square protests, immigrated to the US and eventually got into investing.
 He has an incredible track record.
 He founded Himalaya Capital, mostly invested in China and became close friends with Charlie Munger.
 He introduced Charlie to the BYD Investment which is how it happened for Berkshire.
 If youre wondering this name doesnt sound super familiar.
 I didnt know he worked at Berkshire.
 Thats because he never did.
 He never did.
 This is unbelievable, even at the beginning of the article front page of The Wall Street Journal, they get the money quote from Charlie.
 Charlie is quoted as saying it is a foregone conclusion that Li would join Berkshire.
 They even have a picture with him.
 There was a picture of Buffett.
 Its crazy.
 Totally crazy.
 What happened?
 How did this blow up?
 The world may never know exactly but the scuttlebutt is that it all came down to compensation.
 The thing is, you know Li was and is incredibly successful on his own, running his own fund where he keeps two and management fees and of the profits.
 Yes, it would be like this amazing honor to go work at Berkshire to be Buffetts successor, but like Warren back in the day with the GrahamNewman partnership where they offered him the keys and he was like wait, why would I run your firm where youre keeping a piece of it?
 I just could do my own thing and Ill keep all the profits.
 I think thats what happened with Li.
 He didnt join.
 He still runs Himalaya.
 Hes been incredibly successful.
 By all accounts still has a warm relationship with Charlie and Warren.
 That threw a wrench in the process, I think.
 Ill bet.
 I did read about the investment managers and well get to the second one here in a minute, how theyre compensated.
 Warren does let it slip in an interview that they basically are compensated for their performance above the SP every year.
 Theres some year characteristic to it where theyre paid on a year basis.
 Theres an opportunity for basically Berkshire to have a claw back if they underperform in the latter years of the year rolling basis.
 You can see for somebody like Li, this is total speculation and rumors that are online, its never been confirmed one way or the other but supposedly the other candidate according to rumors was David Einhorn from Greenlight Capital I think.
 The famous hedge fund manager.
 But for folks like that, its not an attractive value proposition really to go work at Berkshire.
 But for Todd whos running a small million hedge fund, this is the chance of a lifetime.
 When this interview came out, I dont know, a few years ago maybe more the capital pull for each investment manager was billion.
 Even on its own, its a very large hedge fund, even your little sliver that youre managing.
 Yup.
 Huge opportunity for Todd.
 He joined at the end of .
 It turns out though that Warren and Charlie didnt know it at the time but they werent actually done with the hiring.
 As they referenced in theyre going to bring on several candidates.
 Do you know how we talked about on thewe havent talked about on the series yet, but we talked about this on the Pinduoduo episode that Warren does these annual charity lunches that he auctions off?
 The auctions actually happened on eBay which is amazing.
 Thats awesome.
 I didnt realize the charity is the Glide Memorial Church here in San Francisco, a great organization involved in many great things over the years.
 In the same year where this is all going down, an anonymous bidder paid a record .
 million for lunch with Warren.
 The next year in it turns out, its announced that the same bidder paid .
 million again.
 One person has paid .
 million for two lunches with Warren.
 Wait, Ted gets the job because he paid for lunches with him twice, millions of dollars?
 Yes.
 .
 million for a job at Berkshire.
 Oh my God.
 Yes listeners, of course were talking about Ted, Ted Weschler.
 The other investment manager at Berkshire today was before Berkshire, running a fairly large billion hedge fund called Peninsula Capital Advisors that he was running for years.
 Hes been immensely successful over those years.
 He had over Xed the capital in the fund.
 Done very, very well, ran a concentrated portfolio, his top holdings were Davita and DirectTV.
 For two years in a row, he buys lunch with Warren and he impresses Warren so much with these lunches that they reach a deal to bring Ted on.
 Thats crazy.
 Isnt that crazy?
 The wheels have to start turning at this point, for listeners out there who are like, Ben, you said theyre each running billion.
 Do they get to run their own hedge funds?
 This is something that I dont think we totally know what the decision making process is.
 How much are they there to execute the Buffett and Munger style versus how much are they there to say, look we have a risk profile that were comfortable with.
 Heres how weve been doing it, go to town.
 Yeah.
 I think the answer is its somewhere in between in terms of how much autonomy Todd and Ted have versus Warren and Charlie.
 It turns out in the same year as Ted joins, theres a little bit of a scandal.
 Remember we told you to remember the name David Sokol?
 In Berkshire fully acquired a chemical company named Lubrizol for billion.
 It turns out that the person that first got interested in acquiring said Lubrizol company was David Sokol, then running the energy business within BerkshireHathaway.
 Everybody widely assumed and Buffett had basically implied that the name on the envelope to be the CEO of the business of that side when Warren stepped down was David.
 It was his job to lose.
 Well, it turns out that for some literally unfathomable reason because its not like he needed the money, I would assume, David front rammed the trade with the acquisition of Lubrizol.
 Its a publicly traded company before.
 Its a publicly traded company before Berkshire acquired it.
 He personally bought shares in the company and then suggested to Warren that Warren look into buying the company as a whole.
 That in itself isnt that bad.
 Its like, hey, Im personally invested in this company, I think its great.
 The problem was that after they started negotiating to buy the company and David I think was involved in the negotiations, he kept buying in knowing that this was going on definitely, I dont know.
 He didnt end up being prosecuted or went to jail or anything, but once all this comes out, Buffett fires him or he leaves Berkshire.
 Buffett makes statements that he cant believe that this happened and he cant understand why David did it.
 That leaves the new name in the envelope, so to speak, as Davids former number two, now number one in the energy business Greg Abel.
 Who also came over in the midAmerican energy acquisition?
 As we now know Greg is indeed going to be the next CEO of BerkshireHathaway.
 Weve got the chess pieces here.
 We now know Ajits name for insurance.
 We know Gregs name as sort of the noninsurance businesses.
 Hes going to be the CEO.
 Weve got Ted and Todd, each managing their pool of money probably close to billion now each on the public equity side.
 Warren has said, I think, when they started it was about billion each that they are managing.
 As they proved themselves, he gave them more rope.
 But in the early days here, Warren is still managingwere talking to Charlie, but really Warren is still managing most of the investing for Berkshire.
 To be honest, hes given it to Ted and Todd right away, because he does a pretty terrible job, we cant mince words here.
 In retrospect, these years between and I think were probably some of the worst decisions that Buffett ever made and worst horrors of his career.
 He has admitted publicly, I mean not necessarily the way that you just phrased it, but he definitely has admitted publicly that Ted and Todd outperformed him.
 Yeah, that they did.
 I think he made that comment in .
 He said, yeah, they both beat the SP by a little bit but they smoked me.
 Yeah, they definitely smoked him.
 In November was a weird year for Warren.
 Lubrizol purchase.
 Yeah.
 Hiring Ted which is great but because of the charity lunches, its just weird.
 In November for some God knows why reason, Warren finally pulled the trigger on the trade that he has been itching to make for years.
 He put .
 billion into IBM, in .
 Lets just take a quick refresher here, .
 Four years after the App Store was launched.
 Seven years after Facebook was launched.
 This is not way back in time when it might have made sense.
 Three years after the famous Jeff Bezos talk at the Startup School.
 Thats exactly what I was going to say.
 about AWS.
 AWS is already a thing.
 That is the default for startups and has been for years to go and be the cloud provider.
 What on earth?
 What thesis does he have on IBM?
 Well, heres his thesis.
 This is what he says publicly.
 He says, he has been hit between the eyes by how great IBM is and how strong and defensible its client relationships are.
 Brutal.
 If this is the first technology investment that Warren Buffett is going to make, maybe its a good thing he didnt make any technology investments.
 Maybe its half a century too late.
 Yeah, seriously.
 He holds this thing until when he finally sells it, all told he loses billion in total sales or for wherever on little over billion.
 But the opportunity cost of billion of capital in you put that into IBM?
 My God.
 Think about if you bought any other big tech company.
 Just pick one, you would have done great.
 Warren, go back to the monkey throwing darts.
 Then in he partnered with the private equity firm G Capital to take Craft Private and then merge it with Hines.
 Warren, youre partnering with a private equity firm?
 Theyre your enemy, you know what they do, right?
 Anyway, Berkshire puts billion into that deal.
 Their equity stake in KraftHeinz today is worth about billion.
 They havent lost money but again opportunity cost to capital here.
 That was .
 Anyway, in Berkshire acquired the aircraft parts manufacturer Precision Castparts for billion in Berkshires largest deal ever, bigger evenwe skipped over the railroad.
 In they finally bought the railroad.
 That was a good deal.
 That has done well for Berkshire.
 Warren Buffett from to he was good.
 He was good in those years.
 But Precision Castparts, he bought it for billion last year they took a billion write down on that deal.
 Thats a dog.
 The worst that we alluded to, oh my God, in he started investing in the airlines.
 This is the man who said that he was going to shoot it down Orville and Wilbur.
 What was he thinking?
 Well, the interesting thing is so he sold the airlines in a panic sale right when the pandemic dip started and we all know of course there was about five days where you could actually buy the dip before it came skyrocketing back.
 Somehow we didnt endure a real market crash in this global pandemic because of monetary policy.
 Thank you Jerome Powell.
 Buffett basically sells at the bottom with these airlines and its interesting because I dont fault him for the sale.
 It is a very reasonable thing to sell the airlines then because if the government didnt bail them out, they could have all gone to zero.
 I mean the government was paying some airlines payroll to make it through that period.
 Even though he sold it, I think right around the worstthe bottom, I blame it on the buy.
 He knew that he even had a comment years before that he had a romantic fascination or like a dirty habit about owning airlines or something like that.
 He knew when he still did.
 Its like you cant have newspapers anymore, so he wants the airlines.
 To be fair to Warren, again the scuttlebutt here is and theres some comments to this effect that it actually was I think Ted who first got interested in the airlines and they talked about it.
 Its just funny, but you cant not make fun of Warren for this one.
 Its bad.
 You can chalk this up, so you shouldve known better.
 Yup.
 IBM, Precision Castparts, those were bad.
 Honestly in this same time period, JJ wasnt great, the investment he did there.
 The rail cars that I mentioned were around not that great.
 Not great.
 Those are all the sins of commission, not to mention the sins of omission of Google, Facebook, Amazon.
 On top of all this, you own AmEx, you understand AmEx.
 You understand the brilliance behind what became the credit card interchange business and you let a IPO by MasterCard and a IPO by Visa go right by you.
 These are crazy old companies that have been locked up inside the bank federations or however they were owned before, theyre finally available for the public to buy.
 These stocks were criminally undervalued initial issuances and Buffett just watches them go right by, knowing the AmEx business, its crazy.
 I hadnt thought about that.
 Youre right, to be allocating all this capital to these dog businesses, when Visa and MasterCard put the tech companies aside that are just sitting there, brutal.
 Okay, so were hammering on Warren here, rightly so.
 But there is one shining, saving, all sin absolving addition to Berkshires portfolio during this time.
 Thats right, we are talking about the very same company that was Sequoia Capitals worst mistake ever by selling before the IPO.
 Berkshire and Warren redeems everything by buying Apple Inc.
 Amazing.
 Amazing.
 Heres the story.
 In May of as Warren puts it in the quote, one of the fellows in the office who manages money Aka Ted.
 yup.
 Its never been said whether it was Todd or Ted, but I think it was Ted here because Todd really focuses on financial stocks and Ted does everything else.
 As Warren puts it, had put some money into Apple and indeed had put about billion, lets assume it was Ted, into Apple shares in May of .
 That goes well.
 Amazingly, Ted, Todd or whomever manages to convince Warren that this is a good idea.
 I guess hes broken the seal with investing in IBM in technology stocks and he convinces Warren that they should really back up the truck here in Apple.
 Over the next two years, BerkshireHathaway would ultimately put billion to work buying Apple stock, just under the total price that they paid for Precision Castparts, which was the largest acquisition in Berkshires history.
 To say it goes phenomenally well is the understatement of the century.
 Yeah.
 This is unreal.
 Im sure theres lots of people out there who have been Apple shareholders from to .
 Your brokerage accounts know what were talking about here.
 Lots of people doing this, not a lot of people doing this with billion in initial principal.
 As of the annual report of last year, the market value of Berkshires shares in Apple is worth billion.
 That is billion of gains in five years.
 I think, I cant figure this out exactly but I think that is either more or close to more absolute dollar returns than the entire rest of Warren Buffetts career investing, even including the partnerships.
 Lets just say that again, more or close to more dollar returns then the entire rest of Warren Buffetts career that has come in the last five years with one stock.
 I mean, theres two angles to this.
 One, the irony is just dripping.
 Dripping.
 Warren NoTechStock Buffett and Apple is approximately of the dollars ever returned.
 The other side of it is interesting because it basically is just a math problem.
 Of course, the last five years of something thats been compounding for years, years.
 Of course, the dramatic amount of the value is going to show up in the last five, whatever youre investing and assuming that youre continuing to find a reasonable rate of return because thats how compounding works.
 But, holy crap.
 The position was initiated when the man was years old.
 From some conversations I had, when Ted brought it up and sold Warren on the idea, the angle was not that it was a technology company, but more in spite of the fact that it was a technology company.
 We got to talk about this.
 The biggest piece of positioning from what Ive heard is that its a consumer product with a powerful brand name, very low propensity for people to switch, theres a high lock in.
 There is a strong moat there.
 In fact it may even be the most valuable brand in the world.
 Now that weve planted that seed, I would like to go and once again read the quote from the annual meeting.
 What were trying to find is a business that for one reason or another, it can be because of the low cost producer in some area, it can be because it has a natural franchise because of surface capabilities.
 It could be because of its position in the consumers mind.
 It can be because of a technological advantage, or any reason at all, that it has this moat around it.
 I dont think that there is any better description of why you would want to buy and hold Apple and that exact quote from him years before.
 Its so great.
 Heres the thing, this is nitpicking because at the end of the day investing, it doesnt matterI played baseball growing up.
 My dad used to say to me, if youre listening.
 Hi dad.
 I was learning mechanics on how to swing properly.
 I love this quote, he used to say, look, if you could hit in the big leagues, nobody would care if you stood on your head when you swung.
 All that matters is you hit but until you learn how to hit you should probably do it the right way.
 Investing is the same way.
 Nobody cares what your thesis is.
 Nobody cares if youre right or wrong.
 Nobody cares why you bought the stock.
 At the end of the day, you just want to be in a position to be right.
 Warren got himself in a position to be right.
 That said, I dont think he understands anything about how Apple works or what it does or why all of this works.
 He has a quote at the annual meeting.
 He says, I didnt go into Apple because it was a tech stock.
 I dont think that it required me to take apart an iPhone or something and figure out what all the components were or anything.
 I think its much more the nature of consumer behavior.
 Yeah, hes in it for the M.
 Hes really impressed by the architecture.
 Hes locked in to iMessage.
 He feels that this integrated strategy is the right one.
 How funny is that?
 At the end of the day though, it doesnt matter.
 It doesnt matter that it was Teds idea.
 It doesnt matter that Warren hated technology stocks.
 All that matters is that he was in a position to be right.
 billion of gains later, here we are.
 Yeah, that has to be up there with the single greatest investment return in history in terms of absolute dollars.
 I think it is.
 Lets see, Naspers Tencent.
 Naspers Tencent and Softbank Alibaba investments, I think theyre still better.
 But were splitting hairs here.
 Well, they bought those companies in the first five years of their life.
 Remarkably Warren and Ted achieved this performance by buying Apple years into its life.
 Yeah.
 That just says a lot about No years into its life.
 The Fang stocks in the last few years.
 It does.
 That is the big beat that were going to end on, but lets bring it all home.
 January of Berkshire officially appoints Greg and Ajit to vice chairman roles in the company.
 Greg for vice chairman of noninsurance businesses.
 Ajit for insurance businesses.
 The pandemic of course happens in March of .
 Warren preaches his faith in America, but he dumps the airlines at the bottom, which I agree with you, thats fine.
 Berkshire mostly misses out on the enormous bullrun that happens when Jerome Powell and the FED inject literally more money than God into the economy.
 Warren and Charlie continue to say that they think their crypto is rat poison squared.
 But as far as I can tell, at least, I dont think theyve made any attempt to actually study or understand what Bitcoin, Ethereum or any crypto actually is.
 The kicker of the big moments that we all, if not, saw or heard about the day after, the hilarious slip at the annual meeting where Charlie lets it slip that Greg Abel is the name in the envelope.
 This clip is so funny, well link to it in the show notes, but Warren and Charlie are on stage bickering about Berkshires culture and about preserving the culture, Charlie just goes, Greg will preserve the culture.
 Yup.
 The look on Warrens face is priceless.
 Yeah, he stammers.
 Hopefully weve pointed out in the now like what hours weve been doing this series.
 Nine, David, dont get ridiculous.
 This dichotomy between how Warren is perceived and wants to be perceived and how he actually is.
 Hes got that line about Charlie and I have never had an argument.
 Bullshit, youve never had an argument.
 I bet you had one after that.
 But of course, they still love each other and Greg will be the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.
 We should say to that a thing thats been happening quietly in the backgroundtwo things.
 Ted and Todd have been running their portfolios in a very different way than Warren has over the years.
 I think Todd, and I dont know this for sure but, was really buying Amazon, SnowFlake, some of these tech stocks other than Apple, so you have a nonWarren approved strategy going on there.
 Especially the Snow Flake deal, buying those preIPO shares and benefiting from that is very interesting.
 Then also, stock buybacks.
 Its very clear that whats happening is that they dont see a better opportunity out there in the market to deploy capital than the businesses they already own.
 Theyd rather just take everybodys shares and concentrate their positions in the existing Berkshire portfolio.
 I thought Christopher Bloomstran had a great quote in the Semper Augustus Investments Group letter that he writes that is epic.
 It is a full analysis of the accounting practices and valuation model for Berkshire.
 He has this great quote, as long as capital markets remain overvalued and private investors flush with cash persist in investing at low yields, share repurchases are a magnificent use of capital.
 It really is such a good point that you pick your head up, you look around, everythings got a sky high multiple on it.
 Berkshire shares at least the way that Warren sees it dont.
 They dont.
 Now its a little bit tricky to think about it this way because the intrinsic value of their equities holdings are marched to the market.
 If you say Berkshires not trading at a crazy valuation.
 I mean a big portion of what they hold is publicly traded equities that are at a higher than ever multiple however you want to mention it.
 There is this interesting thing where by doing stock buybacks, sure, theyre not buying into any new companies that have crazy valuations but they are buying more of the companies they already own at market prices.
 Yup.

 David, I wrote up a little bear and bull case.
 As we start to translate a little bit totheres a playbook that we should enter here but now that were sitting in the present day, why dont we reflect a little bit on the present day and in the future.
 One bull case that I dont think weve really talked about is a lot of people sort of think Berkshires toast when Buffett retires.
 I dont think hell retire until he passes away.
 The stocks going to plummet.
 Their performance is going to go away.
 I think if youve been listening to our episode, you probably dont think that.
 You might think the opposite.
 Right.
 The bull case is they actually could do better under Greg.
 They might be less conservative.
 They could run the business by keeping less cash on hand which is of course a drag on returns.
 Frankly, theres an argument that Warren has gotten really gun shy in buying stuff after a lot of the sins of omission and commission that we mentioned above.
 Its not clear that he trusts his instinct in this environment.
 The only thing that he clearly trusts is to just do the stuff that has worked in the past.
 Im not sure thats well suited for this environment.
 Not to mention Todd and Ted are pretty good.
 No matter what else theyve done, they did Apple.
 Everything else surrounding air, and especially when theyre only managing billion between them, I mean what did you say billion gain or something like that?
 billion.
 billion, unbelievable.
 Theres certainly that element.
 One more piece of context on that, thats a whole Zoom of gains.
 He literally created a Zoom market cap worth of gains.
 Its totally wild.
 Now the flip side, the bear case is Warren has been successful in a lot of environments.
 The thing you should cheerlead about Warren Buffett is that hes reasonably consistent.
 Someone will always be outperforming him but he has created this incredible rate of compounding for over half a century.
 While I think the case that David and Ive been making here for this whole episode is that the Internet changes things so fundamentally that his style doesnt really work anymore, that you do have to make that space on the earth changing underneath you rather than just the earth staying the same and businesses being run.
 The bear case on Berkshire would be, and actually is the opposite, at some point the Buffett way of investing, world changing or not, will actually be great.
 Were just in a season right now that is just making him look foolish.
 Maybe its been or years of largely foolish decisions, Im not sure this is where I come down but that would be the future bear case if Berkshire changes too much from the long time tested Buffett strategy.
 I would also add another part to the bear case which is warranted or not, right or not or whatever, there is no question that Berkshire Hathaway and Berkshire Hathaway shareholders benefit from the Warren Buffett halo effect.
 Absolutely.
 There are some real tangible benefits to that like during the financial crisis where like, my god, those deals he was getting on debt and preferred equity coupons, nobody was getting that.
 The calls he was getting were real tangible benefits.
 There are some intangible benefits, I definitelylots of people, I think ourselvesmyself at least included now having done all this work is, alright Warren, youre past the hill on investing.
 Lots of people give him a pass and people still show up to the shareholders meeting and people still hold Berkshire Hathaway shares because they believe in Warren.
 If Warrens no longer there, then what?
 Yeah, Berkshire Hathaway is a religion and an investment.
 The bear case is that at some point it just becomes an investment.
 Yup.
 A little bit more bear case stuff.
 If you think about capital allocation, if you think about maybe the way Jeff Bezos does it, ideally there are lots of potential growth engines inside your company to invest in, to allocate your capital to.
 Otherwise, you have to go and fight it out with every other investor for every publicly available investment vehicle.
 The only growth engine that Berkshire really has a meaningful growth engine is Geico and thats not a real growth engine.
 Its really hard for them to consume capital internally in a way that would meet any hurdle rate that would be exciting.
 They have to keep going shopping to deploy capital at this point.
 Theres an element there thats a little bit scary if youre thinking about investing in a tech company versus Berkshire which of course, you never really should be thinking about one or the other.
 Theyre completely different buckets, but they dont have an internal growth engine inside that company.
 The last one is a little bit more nuanced angle on the thing that I mentioned before about if you do a sum of parts analysis on Berkshire then you have to look at everything thats currently marked to market which is eye popping.
 Theres definitely a lot of people out there that think that the stock is trading at a discount of the intrinsic book value of the holdings.
 That, of course, would be the case if you fully valued the cash thats on their balance sheet.
 But if you think about the multiples of the stocks that they own, I mean Apple has gone from being valued at something like X earnings to now like X earnings.
 To believe that Berkshire is underpriced argument, its fundamentally based on agreeing that Apple is worth what its trading for, which maybe is true with Apple but youre also agreeing that BNSF is worth industry multiples for railroads which if youd look around are also meaningfully expanded recently.
 I just think asset prices are really high.
 Theres definitely this element of if you believe Berkshires undervalued then I think youre being pretty generous with how you value the sum of all the parts.
 Yup.
 I think thats true but theres the capital allocation question of all assets being overvalued right now, so if youre going to take capital out of Berkshire, where are you going to put it?
 Right.
 Everything is only worth talking about when you compare it to its next best option.
 Yup.
 If anybody has any really good options for really solid assets that are under price right now, the Acquired Slack acquired.
fmslack, go .
 Well let folks hang out at the investments channel.
 I love it.
 Yup.
 Hang out the digital assets channel.
 That is where stuff is going on.
 Thats where its at.
 Playbook?
 Playbook, lets do it.
 You want to kick it off?
 Yeah.
 I mean the biggest one thats just so clear to me is that you need different strategies at different scales.
 The same playbook clearly didnt work as they gained more capital.
 There was that great thing that they were doing forever of hiring great managers that were family owned businesses that they bought for hundreds of millions of dollars and let them run and those things compound and you could be management light.
 It just doesnt work anymore.
 You need a completely, completely different playbook.
 The interesting point that I want to make on that Just like the original cigar butt playbook stopped working and they had to go to Exactly.
 The point that I want to make is that they have set themselves up well where they have a remarkably flexible structure to do that.
 Its not a fund.
 Its an operating company.
 They have an infinite time horizon.
 The goal is to never sell.
 Theres no drag of fees.
 Theres no drag of fees.
 As a shareholder, you can feel pretty good aboutthe sticker performance is actually the performance youre going to get.
 Youre not getting that less than .
 Incentives are aligned.
 If theyre not investing, theyre not just sitting there collecting fees, they are itching too, because they think that the best option for that capital right now is to sit in cash.
 Even though we were knocking Warren for like hes out of touch and he doesnt understand the Internet, and he doesnt understand internet businesses and the world change from underneath him, we spilled a lot of words on that.
 What he did get right is this operating companys flexible structure and probably set it up for success, I say probably because we have an open question on culture and politics, but leaving enough flexibility inside the company then to make sure that they can react to whatevers coming.
 Even if its not in the Warren style.
 That was a big one that I had.
 Say more about politics unless youre saving it for later.
 No, Im not.
 This is something that concerns me.
 You went from having one person making all decisions, where if capital was best used on acquisitions that we could use there, if capital was best used plowing it into an internal growth engine when they had meaningful internal growth engines, you can use it there.
 Like Ajits business.
 Yup.
 Yup.
 If they wanted to buy stock in companies, they could go do that.
 Now, each of those are independent fiefdoms.
 Im sure theres ways they can sort of do horse trading, but peoples comp largely is tied directly to their own portfolio, so who gets to say at the end of the day, no, this is what were doing.
 I guess its Greg.
 I guess its the CEO, but you really have to nail the incentives to make that all work.
 When you have a nonfounder who doesnt quite have the same influence and purview over all of those things, I think decision making, especially when you need to be able to do it in an hour for a really big deal, could get really thorny.
 Not to mention a CEO who doesnt have the investing mind that Warren does.
 Greg is great.
 Hes a great operating executive, but is he going to be able to think in the same way as Warren and Todd and Ted about investments and act with the same speeding conviction.
 Right.
 What the right thing to do here has been to go try like crazy.
 It might be very hard if not impossible to go find a Warren Buffett and just give it all to them.
 Sure, they have these other guys as employees but do you need a one headed monster.
 This is the funny thing about the number one criteria for the next CEO being operating experience in a large company, thats not Warren.
 Right.
 Yes, we may never know.
 It may be years before a book comes out, but Ill be very curious to see how contentious decisions get made between that new group of four that is coming in and if just Warner or just Charlie is left at some point with the four, what does that look like?
 That will be weird for a little bit.
 I imagine if one of them leaves, they both leave at the same time.
 I would imagine too.
 The other thing Ill say on culture and this is borrowed from some great research that some listeners sent us, their culture, they talk about it like its this virtuous thing.
 If its truly this virtuous thing then its something that you can codify and protect.
 I think that cultures are really independent inside each of these operating companies.
 I dont think if youre an employee of Borsheims, I dont really think you think about Lubrizols culture.
 They have nailed it on the decentralization thing.
 I think the only real shared cultural elements inside the hundreds of thousands of people that work inside or for Berkshire Hathaway are one, dont put Berkshires reputation at risk.
 Two, bend over backwards to avoid paying tax which takes money out of the business.
 Dont take money out of business.
 Leave it all in.
 Keep compounding it.
 Differ it however you can.
 Three, funnel all cash back to Berkshire for reallocation.
 I mean thats the culture.
 Those are the things that are really important to the head office for managers at their subsidiaries to follow.
 Yup.
 Should we go to grading?
 Yeah.
 Lets do this.
 I know you have a whole slate of ways that we could grade this one, so kick us off.
 Yeah, this is it.
 The whole story, hours in.
 Okay, I was thinking before we recorded about how to grade this.
 I dont usually write down any thoughts on grading before episodes, but I thought this was so momentous.
 You guys know David Rosenthal.
 He just wings it.
 He doesnt really prep.
 Well, I do in grading.
 I think there are four topics to discuss in grading here.
 First, weve been through this whole thing.
 I think we got to grade Warrens entire career.
 Hopefully, theres still a little bit more time, I dont know, maybe not.
 Probably, I hope not that theres not more timeI hope theres more time in his life, but not in his investment decision making career.
 I think were basically at the end here, one way or another.
 The man is years old.
 Either way dude, were shipping this episode, so create the cut off.
 Yeah.
 We create the career, I think we grade performance since we left off the last episode which was in .
 I did an IRR calc of January through today.
 Great.
 I love it.
 Then I think we should grade recent years performance and then the final question, I am a Berkshire Hathaway shareholder.
 I have been for a long time.
 I dont know if you are, but whether you are or not, you could pretend you are.
 If you are, what do you do with your stock?
 Are you holding?
 Are you selling?
 Are you buying more?
 Interesting.
 David, do you have a rate of return calculation on that, the entire Buffett career?
 As a matter of fact, I do.
 I did some analysis on this.
 The entire Buffett career, so if you amalgamate years in the partnership years at a .
 IRR during those years and you amalgamate that with then years since the partnership through years, incredible in the Berkshire time frame.
 Berkshire over that time period has had a IRR.
 You get a blended IRR of .
 across years of active money management for Warren.
 That guys consistent.
 Quite consistent.
 The more incredible number, do you know what invested in the Warren Buffett Partnerships in and held through Berkshire today would be worth today?
 take a guess.
 Millions but compounding math breaks my brain, I dont know.
 .
 million.
 Not bad for a hundred.
 Wow, take a flyer in, what did you say, ?
 .
 I mean thats a long time.
 That was a lot more money then, but inflation has moved this fast.
 Thats a great stat, at the beginning of Warren Buffetts career following them all the way through is over million.
 Yeah.
 Remarkable.
 Thats a something percent IRR?
 Over his whole career, he flagged.
 Its not the same as the BPL or the Buffett Partnership Limited days but mighty good.
 Yeah, mighty good indeed.
 What, A, A plus?
 Has anyone else been investing over this period of time?
 I dont even know how to compare it to anything similar.
 He outlasted everyone.
 Yeah, he outlasted everybody.
 I wrote down A.
 Heres my rationale for an A.
 We can debate if this holds.
 My rationale for an A versus an A plus was that I think we will probably see better investors in our lifetime than Warren in the past.
 I think thats just a natural consequence of the numbers getting bigger over time and the world moving faster and there being more change.
 It depends what you mean better investors, because I actually dont think so, depending on how you think about this.
 Im not sure that you can do what Warren did over his career with the career starting today without taking on a lot more risk or a lot more leverage.
 Its just so competitive to be an investor now.
 I suspect if we set a million people free over the next years, there will be someone who outperforms Warren, but they will have done it with a lot more risk involved.
 Theres a lot more luck in being the one of those million that does better than him.
 Okay, so here was my thinking on that.
 I tried to think of it like I did not run the numbers so I may just be way off, we can debate.
 I tried to think of a tangible example and the tangible example Ive thought of is Sequoia Capital as a whole.
 When was it?
 theyre coming up on years next year.
 We dont have their aggregate returns across all their funds, but I suspect they might be as good or better than Berkshire.
 Interesting.
 Now, not a single person, its a firm.
 But its an institutionalized culture and if you can do something consistently, you deserve to be in the same conversation.
 Here was my thought process on it.
 Apple aside, which we cant really put Apple aside, Warren deserves credit for that .
 But absolutely hes lost a step in recent years, whereas I feel Sequoia has only gotten better or stayed at the top of its game.
 Yeah.
 I mean it feels like they adjust to the climate that theyre in a year before the climate changes.
 It feels like Buffett adjusts years after.
 No, just on IBM.
 Maybe years afterwards.
 Yup.
 Thats a good question though.
 Its interesting.
 But remember that thing I mentioned earlier with the expected value calculation of the probability something could happen in the outcome, it happens.
 Sequoia is doing the exact opposite of the Buffett thing.
 Its a shot on goal where each shot could be absolutely huge.
 Its obviously an extremely different asset class.
 Yup.
 But it is an approach that I think is more suited toif you believe the hypothesis that the world today is more about change than Buffetts world when he was in his prime, the Sequoia approach is the better approach in todays world I think.
 Fascinating.
 Were going to rile up all the growth versus value people out there.
 I love it.
 What do you think?
 Ill put the gun in your hands.
 A or A plus?
 Its an A.
 I mean, if he had finished strong it would be an A plus.
 You could argue Apple is finishing strong but just the numbers that I ran for this last period, through today is at .
 IRR.
 Thats and a half years.
 Its not like this is a quick cycle.
 This is like two or three cycles.
 Its not like you cant just say his .
 IRR was during a down cycle for Buffett style.
 No, weve been through some stuff.
 Its just not been a remarkable last years.
 That number by the way is just based on their stock price.
 Its coming in at January st, .
 Their stock just closed at a share.
 Its so great.
 This is good.
 This is the next set of grading criteria.
 Maybe we can jump back to an overall view at the end.
 Lets compare that .
.
 Remember the Buffett Partnership Limited.
 That was .
.
 Then in the last episode where we talked about the heyday of Berkshire Hathaway ending in the Solomon, that was a IRR in the s and the late s through the mids.
 It has diminished considerably which they told us it would because of the amount of capital theyre managing, but still.
 Yup.
 What do we think?
 Is this a B for this period?
 Yeah, its a B.
 Its a B.
 Its still definitely beat the SP.
 Beating the market for sure, but just not to his previous standards.
 Yup.
 Okay.
 Recent years, I did a slightly different What does recent years mean?
 Lets take the last five years starting from the Apple investment, which is almost exactly five years ago.
 Whats your analysis?
 This I think was interesting and telling to me.
 Like weve been saying, the Apple investment is so amazing in the running for one of the best single investments of all time.
 Yet, Berkshire is so being in this law of gravity around the capitalist, so meaningful.
 Warrens other investments were so bad that in aggregate, Berkshires stock price performance over the last five years on a multiple basis is almost exactly the same as the SP.
 Even including Apple.
 It has tracked the market and not outperformed at all for the last five years.
 Now if you take out Apple, its underperformed by about half a turn on a multiple level from the market.
 Ted and Todd are making money, but Warrens not getting paid out in any of his carry.
 Warren is literally doing worse than the market in the last five years.
 Right.
 Thats so interesting to think about.
 Because hes necessarily underperforming the SP because he said Ted and Todd were over performing it.
 Yup.
 Berkshire as a whole is just simply tracking.
 Thats pretty bad.
 I mean thats a C to me.
 Its not worse than a C because its not like a hedge fund where theyre taking and .
 Its the exact same thing as being in an index fund.
 Yup.
 I think thats right, a C.
 Yeah.
 Now, the money question, literally the money.
 What are you doing with the money?
 Are we keeping it in Berkshire?
 Are we buying?
 Are we selling?
 Are we holding?
 This is the moment I reveal for everyone hours in that I actually have never held Berkshire Hathaway.
 No way.
 Weve done all of this work.
 Yeah.
 This is not investment advice.
 Especially, this part is not investment advice and we really do urge you to talk to someone who knows about this stuff when considering making a purchase.
 But Ive never ownedIve thought about it a lot and especially in this research, I considered buying it many times.
 The place I basically arrived is its very conservatively managed as a Berkshire expert quoted to me, its a good widows and orphans stock.
 Frankly, I think its a good way for someone whos rich to stay rich because of the way that they manage capital.
 I mean they dont dividend out.
 If you make a bunch of money every year, then you dont have to pay high taxes on the dividends.
 It will continue to compound.
 You can sell shares when you want to sell shares to free up some cash.
 Its not going to have a really big down year.
 Maybe if theres an extreme hurricane event but its not going to have five really big down years.
 I think that question comes down to where are you in your investing cycle in your life?
 Im not sure that it makes sense for young people to buy Berkshire.
 At least, people that are young in their wealth.
 Yup.
 I differ from you in answer but agree with you in spirit and rationale.
 My answer, I am a registered holder as I said at the top of the series, has been for many years.
 Im going to continue to hold partially due to the style drift for that and the way of Warren, the halo effect.
 I get my free tickets to the shareholder meeting should they ever resume in person.
 But the real reason Im going to continue to hold is actually just a portfolio management strategy.
 Its not a large allocation of my portfolio.
 Almost all of the rest of my portfolio isliterally the rest of my portfolio is heavy growth tech stocks, digital assets, etc.
 San Francisco Real Estate.
 This is for your safety.
 This is in my safety portfolio.
 The way I think about it is just, should I need emergency liquidity for something in the near term, I dont know what that would be, thats what my Berkshire is.
 Its exactly what youre saying.
 Its my bad term, but the equivalent of a widows and orphans fund, terrible term.
 But the capital that I can feel good aboutI actually thought a lot about this over the past year.
 I used to keep an allocation in just a fairly sizable allocation in cash for this purpose.
 Then I was like, well thats just stupid.
 To keep cash is just dumb.
 Again, not investment advice.
 Yeah.
 Not investment advice.
 But when yields on year treasuries are basically negative Right.
 Just sitting there getting devalued in my bank.
 Yeah.
 Literally every day that goes by, youre getting poorer and poorer holding cash.
 Again, not investment advice.
 Thats when I decided Im really worth this and Im going to have to allocate my liquidity allocation to Berkshire.
 Because I can feel pretty confident its not going to be money and Ill at least get some return on the capital.
 I dont know, thats kind of sad for Berkshire that I think of it as an alternative to cash.
 But again, I think thats where the stock is at, at this point.
 Fascinating.
 At hours in and this is where we arrive.
 Not with a bang but a whimper.
 I will say it, the journey is the reward.
 I do want to sum up this grading, this series of course we will get the carve outs here in a second, but the completion of this with possibly the best take on Warren Buffett of anyone, Ho Nam from Altos which is an investment firm that we very much respect, recently tweeted that he is the only investor to build a company worth over billion.
 As Ho puts it, a few amazing founders have done it but no investor comes close.
 Absolutely.
 A great way to leave it.
 However, if youll indulge me, I will spoil it with a less eloquent parting thought that I wanted to add too after.
 Yeah.
 We spent hundreds of hours of research on this.
 Weve read six books.
 I know.
 This is the most quixotic thing that weve ever done.
 Hopefully, you all have enjoyed this as much as we have because it has been an absolute freaking blast.
 Its changed the way I think too.
 Yeah.
 I mean truly.
 We have learned so much from doing this.
 I was trying to really reflect on what I have learned from this?
 What can I take away?
 What are my feelings?
 Theres one thing Im doing about my stock, thats one thing.
 But the real value is in the learning.
 Heres my take, its related to this Warren was the greatest status quo investor of all time idea from Andrew and that the world we live in is different today.
 But I think Warren was right about another concept.
 All throughout his career, hes preached believe in America.
 America is undefeated in terms of capital growth and a place to invest your money.
 I think that may or may not be true to some extent today.
 But I think that concept is absolutely true for the Internet.
 The Internet today to me is like Los Angeles in or whatever it was when Charlie was looking for a city, what was it, that was large enough to have an impact, but still small and growing enough that he could become somebody there.
 Yeah.
 Thats the Internet.
 If theres one thing Ive taken from this its thatthat may change someday, but for the period that were in going forward, just despite all the ups and downs and like, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, all crashed this past weekend, its all noise.
 The Internet is still the future.
 Some listener out there and please drop this in the Slack or tweet at us if you do this, we need a meme with Warren and his slide saying never bet against America.
 We need David Rosenthal, never bet against the Internet.
 Thats right.
 Never bet against the Internet.
 Thats my takeaway.
 I love it.
 Carve outs?
 Carve outs, lets do it.
 Ive got two.
 One very related and the other very unrelated except for my joke at the beginning of the episode.
 The related episode is a book, Phil Fishers Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, a classic.
 Really the counterpoints to the Buffett philosophy and the value investing tribe.
 Phil is the father of growth investing and this book was published in and Phil lived in the Bay Area here in San Francisco.
 I will confess I havent finished the book yet, Im still in the middle of it, but I am riveted.
 The only reason I havent finished it is because we have to finish this episode.
 Its amazing Phil basically saw the future of what tech company dynamics were going to be way back in the day.
 He writes about the value of corporate RD and the paradox that you cant measure the value on the balance sheet of corporate RD and the cost of it may be high and you dont know.
 But the cost of not doing corporate RD is even higher.
 A really great book.
 I highly recommend it.
 Also I believe it was recommended to me originally by Ho Nam, who you were just talking about.
 My gosh.
 Hes everywhere.
 Hes everywhere.
 Then my second carve out is the Xbox Series S.
 I finally got one.
 Sweet.
 I was specifically looking for the S because Im years old, I dont need the X.
 My eyes cant even see well enough for the great graphics, but the S is awesome.
 This thing is pretty cheap.
 I think it was which is not that cheap but the S and Game Pass, it works out to, I dont know, what is it like or something like that all in for a year.
 You get access to hundreds of games and all the best ones.
 Ive been playing Halo, Master Chief Collection.
 Its like Netflix for gaming.
 Thats where your Halo reference came from.
 Thats where the Halo reference is coming from.
 I see.
 It literally is like Netflix for gaming and its so great.
 I havent touched my Switch since I got it, highly recommend it if you can find a Series X or a Series S.
 Game Pass just rocks.
 I think its on the Xbox One too.
 You can use it on the previous generation hardware.
 Sweet.
 Alright, I have two because you have two, but theyre the most connected, my two carve outs have ever been.
 The first is I somehow never saw Goodfellas until this week and that movie is just so choice on so many levels.
 I mean it probably came just because, listeners will now, I just finished The Sopranos and that was my previous car out and wanted more.
 The cast has like overlapping people.
 Its the same freaking people.
 Its amazing.
 But it is a freaking work of art, for anyone who hasnt seen it.
 I mean its like Scorsese at his best, its amazing direction, its amazing cinematography.
 The dialogue is exceptional.
 Its just a tremendous story of this persons life.
 Ive never been a gangster movie person.
 I never thought I was but this is so good.
 Ben, the OG.
 I have not seen it.
 I have to watch it.
 Its great.
 Obviously theres The Godfather.
 Ive got a long rabbit hole to go down of truly OG.
 Just watch one and two, dont do three.
 Yeah.
 Thats what I hear.
 Then my second one is the Goodfellas soundtrack.
 It is hit after hit after hit.
 George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Aretha Franklin and the film finishes with Layla by Derek and the Dominos.
 That is just the best way to wrap up any epic story.
 I think if we had the rights Which Layla, the electric version or the acoustic version?
 The electric.
 Although the acoustic is also great.
 Its great.
 Im an electric fan, though.
 Yeah.
 Theyre both great.
 The electric creates more of an epic conclusion mood that is appropriate for that.
 Well write Eric Clapton and see if we can get the rights to use that on the fade out of this episode.
 Great.
 Actually, we probably wont.
 Im sure hes listening.
 For sure, but whether or not youre a fan of the movie or have seen it, go listen to the soundtrack on Spotify.
 Its so great.
 Do you know when Goodfellas came out?
 Early s.
 I want to say or something like that.
 Shortly before the Solomon brothers scandal.
 Yeah.
 While Warren was still in his real heyday?
 Exactly.
 Alright listeners, were going to leave it there.
 With that, thank you so much to our sponsors.
 Theyve been wonderful, Tiny, Capchase, Vouch.
 Go check them all out.
 We have Slack.
 You know this.
 Come hang out with us.
 Youll like it.
 We have an LP program for people who want to be closer to the show.
 You get to hang out on the Zooms live with us or with people like Brad Stone when were recording a book club episode with them.
 Its super fun.
 Frankly, all that stuff is great and if you want to engage more deeply in the show, you should, but theres nothing like sharing an episode with a friend or social media if you want to.
 But just pass this along if you liked it.
 David and I love getting to share these stories with new people.
 Thank you for joining us on this journey.
 Were so lucky that we get to do this and its so much fun.
 This has been a whole new level of fun, at least.
 I dont know about you.
 As we sit here at about PM.
 Were trapped in this room for four hours.
 So funny.
 It has truly been awesome.
 Alright listeners, thank you so much.
 See you next time.
 Well see you next time.
  may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate andor amusing transcription errors Welcome to season episode of Acquired, the podcast of great technology companies and their stories and playbooks behind them.
 Im Ben Gilbert and Im the cofounder and managing director of Seattlebased Pioneer Square Labs and our venture fund, PSL Ventures.
 Im David Rosenthal and Im an angel investor based in San Francisco.
 We are your hosts.
 Listeners, David and I decided to open this season with the complete story of the firm that totally appended the entire venture capital ecosystem a decade ago, Andreessen Horowitz.
 But as we started researching, of course, that meant telling the journeys of Andreessen and Horowitz themselves before founding the firm.
 Which of course means telling the history of the web browser, the creation of Mosaic, the founding of eventual IPO Netscape, which was the first real internet tech startup, and of course, the tumultuous story of Loudcloud and Opsware.
 And so much more than that that you dont even know, Ben.
 This is great.
 This is the first time Ive literally not opened your notes at all.
 Normally we dont trade notes, but I have no idea what youve prepared.
 Listeners, the impetus for that is that this was going to be a one part episode until last night when David texted me and said, how about we do a twoparter.
 There are really things about Marc and Ben that I did zero research on and Im excited to learn from David along with you all today.
 Im like the old legendary Chicago Cubs short stopper Ernie Banks, Lets play two!
 Well, Im really pumped to do this as a twoparter.
 I think the history of Marc and Ben is really important to understand the world views of both of them and how they were shaped by it.
 I think for all of us working in a startup ecosystem that was so shaped by the creation of the firm Andreessen Horowitz, I think its paramount to understand the things that shaped them because they have shaped us all.
 Im really excited because I feel my investor psychology has already changed since starting the research into Marc and Ben.
 Totally, cant wait to dive in.
 Listeners, two things to be aware of if you like the is our Slack, there is awesome discussion that takes place on not just our episodes but also the tech news of the day going on there.
 Were now strong, so you can come and join us at acquired.
fmslack and is the limited partner program.
 This is where we drop subscriberonlycontent like our library of over interviews and deep dives on company building topics like venture capital fundamentals.
 Youll also get access to our LP Zoom calls with David and I.
 You can click the link in the show notes or go to acquired.

 Before we dive in, we are switching things up this season.
 I would like to welcome our presenting sponsor for all of season pilot.

 Pilot is the backbone of the modern financial stock for startups and is backed by allstar investors like Sequoia, Index, Bezos Expeditions, and Stripe.
 They are truly the gold standard for startup bookkeeping and at this point, most if not all the companies I work with as an angel investor run on them.
 Now over to our conversation with pilot cofounders Waseem Daher and Jessica McKellar.
 For this first episode, can you start off by telling everyone first what Pilot is?
 Then how did you all as highly technical cofounders from MIT decided to come together and start a company focused on accounting?
 Pilot runs the financial back office for your startup.
 We take care of your bookkeeping, your tax prep, budgeting, forecasting, projections, all that good stuff.
 And the way that we do it is we connect you with your Pilot teamfulltime, USbased employees of ours who specialize in working with startups to take this work off your plate.
 Pilot is the third company for Jessica, me, and our cofounder Jeff.
 We all met at MIT and we all studied Computer Science together there.
 Yeah, we were all nerds in the Computer Club at MIT.
 Our first company out of school was rooted in the masters thesis of our other cofounder Jeff Arnold.
 We were building a bootstrap selffunded company around technology for rebootless Kernel updates on Linux.
 Which was really fun Tech to build a profitable business out of, that eventually was acquired by Oracle.
 Part of what sticks out about Ksplice is first, we had to be very tight with our finances because we hadnt taken any external funding.
 As part of that, we needed to do something that every set of business owners, every set of founders needs to do, which is you need to maintain your finances.
 Being the nerds that we are.
 Were like, oh well, well buy a copy of QuickBooks desktop, the book Accounting for Dummies, well do it ourselves, and Im sure itll be great.
 So we did that, Im sure poorly.
 We even wrote some software being who we are to do realtime reconciliation of our books.
 It was funny because during the acquisition conversations with Oracle, the Oracle Finance and Accounting teams were like, why were you doing rebootless Kernel updates?
 Why dont you sell this?
 Why reconciliation stuff?
 I think it is stuck in the back of our minds.
 We ended up extending at Oracle, got back in the saddle, and had another company together that was acquired by Dropbox.
 Were back in the saddle again with Pilot.
 I think that the visceral experience of meeting to take care of your finances to maximize the outcomes for your business and just having no good solution was true years ago and it was still true when we were starting Pilot.
 That was unbelievable to us, and thats a big part of what motivated us to start that company.
 Thats amazing, thank you.
 You can learn more about Pilot and whether they can help your company eliminate the pain of tax prep and bookkeeping by going to pilot.
comacquired.
 Thanks to Jessica and Waseem, all Acquired listenersif you use that linkwill get off your first six months of service.
 Were super excited to have Pilot with us this season.
 They are really great and I can attest that will make your life way easier if you are a founder.
 Well, David take us in and listeners, normally this is where I would warn you that this show is not investment advice.
 David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss in the show, its for informational and entertainment purposes only.
 But this episode, all this stuffs pretty old.
 Good luck investing in any of this defunct technology.
 Were going to be talking about a lot of dead companies in this episode.
 Next time, well be talking about a lot of live companies.
 One disclosure before we jump in here.
 I think this is the first time I have done this on this show.
 I have a new investment vehicle that Im not quite ready to talk about just yet but Im doing it with my buddy Nat Manning, whos the COO of Kettle and should tell everybody that a couple of the GPs at Andreessen Horowitz our LPs in that vehicle.
 I dont think it has affected my telling of the history but everybody should just know that going in.
 Congratulations, David.
 Thanks.
 Super excited.
 Cant wait to talk more about it soon.
 We start with history and facts.
 In in London, Englandnot what you expected.
 Was it, Ben?
 So this is not Marc?
 No, not Marc that were talking about here.
 We are talking about Ben who was born in in London, England.
 I did not know that.
 It was the s, the counterculture is in full swing in London.
 Youve got the mods and the rockersThe Who, The Rolling Stones, all that.
 Bens family that he was born into a young family is living in London at the time.
 Theyre American expats.
 The husband of Bens father had come to London to work for Bertrand Russell, the Philosopher?
 Philosopher, polymath, logician, mathematician.
 Oh, wow.
 So the family already had either one or two children.
 Im not sure if Ben is the second child or the third child.
 But nonetheless, in Benjamin Abraham Horowitz was born, of course, would grow up to become Ben Horowitz.
 So usually, on this show on most episodes, we would just stop there with the family.
 This is the like that our protagonists were born into.
 We can now move on to the people themselves.
 This time were going to spend a little more time on Bens family.
 His moms name is Elissa, then Horowitz and now Krauthamer, and his dad is David, David Horowitz.
 That name may not mean much to probably most people listening, but some of you listening are saying, wait David Horowitz, that David Horowitz?
 I have no idea what youre talking about.
 David was and is a radical political activist and is very much a large and still active part of American History, even though I think most people these days are not aware of it.
 So at this time, the reason he was in London is he was one of the leading young intellectual radicals that were championing the New Left at the time and the counterculture and they were in London.
 He was working with Bertrand Russell, protesting the Vietnam War, and advocating for world peace and worldwide nuclear disarmament.
 Oh, wow.
 He was working with not only Russell but JeanPaul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, James Baldwin, Stokely Carmichael.
 He is in the middle of everything happening in the s.
 This continues for a couple of years and then in David gets an opportunity he cant refuse, which is to move back to America and become the coeditor of the magazine Ramparts, which was one of the leading publications of the hippies and the counterculture.
 They originally published Che Guevaras diaries, its crazy.
 Ramparts was based in Berkeley California, which is how Ben Horowitz ends up growing up in Berkeley California.
 Its funny.
 I knew Ben grew up in Berkeley and I just didnt make the connection that anytime you hear that someone was in Berkeley in the late s, you should ask the question like what were they doing in the counterculture movement.
 What role were they playing and how did they end up there?
 Rather than just being the way you would today, which is like, yeah, its all a bit of a hippiedippie town, but its part of the Bay Area, its part of technology.
 Nice suburb, you get the college campus there, better weather than San Francisco.
 It was a little different back in the day.
 Speaking of different, we know David is sort of already part of the counterculture.
 When they get back to Berkeley get this, he intersects with Huey Newton, the leader of the Black Panthers, and becomes very close with him and with the Panthers.
 When I say very close, I mean very close.
 So he writes about them and Ramparts all the time, helps bring them to National prominence.
 The whole family, including young Ben, would go to the Black Panther church every Sunday in Oakland, the Son of Man Temple.
 This is a little bit certainly outside the scope of Acquired, but just to paint the picture of where Ben came fromthe Black Panther Party.
 If youre not American or from the US and studied American history it was one of the most powerful forces for black and civil rights in American history, and the whole family is right in the middle of it.
 But unlike Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement, the Panthers did not advocate for nonviolence, shall we say.
 Less about the civil disobedience, more about the disobedience.
 More about disobedience.
 I didnt know this but it was actually originally founded as the Black Panther Party for selfdefense.
 The whole purpose of it was to resist police brutality against black people in Oakland, that was the origin of the Black Panthers.
 This was like wild times.
 In FBI director J.
 Edgar Hoover described the Black Panthers as the greatest threat to the internal security of America.
 Thats how wild this was.
 Theyre right in the middle of it, including young Benthe Patty Hearst kidnapping, everything.
 So then in when Ben was eight, an incident happened which changed things very dramatically.
 The Panthers needed help with their bookkeeping.
 Huey turns to David who is sort of running this organization, Ramparts.
 He says, hey, can you help me when youre bookkeeping.
 If only they had Pilot, history would have taken a very, very different course.
 David introduces him to Ramparts bookkeeper, a woman named Betty Van Patter.
 The Panthers bring her on.
 Six months later, Betty disappears, and a few weeks after that her body washes up ashore across the bay in San Francisco.
 The crime was never solved, no one was ever charged, but David and many others believe that she found out too much and the Panthers had ordered her killed.
 Later, Ben of course would write The Hard Thing About Hard Things and live through all this crazy technology stuff.
 You just have to imagine, he was eight and his family went through this.
 A busted IPO doesnt seem so hard after stuff like this.
 Anyway, we will move on and get to Marc and Netscape, Loudcloud, and Andreessen Horowitz now.
 But yeah, its crazy.
 For David, he does a complete and ends up becoming an archconservativist.
 He was one of the primary strategists behind Trumps political strategy for defeating Hillary Clinton in .
 Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller were protges of his.
 Oh, I had no idea.
 David Horowitz Freedom Center is one of the biggest funders of Trump leading political ideology in America.
 Crazy enough they still talk, Ben and David.
 They apparently still have a great relationship.
 There is a wonderful New York Times piece that well link to in the show notes.
 I recommend everybody go read about all of this that came out a few years ago by David Streitfeld about it.
 But yeah, this family history is just wild.
 Thats fascinating, and its so cool that family bonds can transcend and not just political beliefs but deeply seated ideological beliefs about the way the world should be.
 Totally, and yeah that out of all of this, years later comes Andreessen Horowitz.
 Back to Ben, obviously, he soaks all these in.
 It has a huge influence on him, but he also wants to blaze his own path and get out of his dads shadow.
 He gets turned on to this other revolution that is happening in the Bay Area in the s, which is the Computer Revolution.
 He ends up going to Columbia in New York for undergrad and studying Computer Science there.
 Probably, wanting to get away from everything happening in the family life at that point in time.
 He then goes to UCLA afterward and gets a Masters in Computer Science.
 While hes there, he interns at the legendary Silicon Graphics.
 Otherwise known as SGI led by Jim Clark who will come up later many times.
 Hes definitely going to come up in the story and SGI is just legendary.
 I dont think weve talked about them as much on Acquired, but they were right alongside Intel, Microsoft, and Apple.
 One of the big early computing companies in Silicon Valley.
 The current Google Campus was originally the SGI Campus.
 They did not just graphical computing but D graphical computing.
 They did the effects for tons of Hollywood movies like Terminator, Jurassic Park, the N Nintendo video game console, which is going to come back up later in the story, SGI made that.
 They made the processors for the N.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 So if you played Mario Kart back in the day, you have SGI.
 The thing that I know that were going to talk about later about N coming back up makes way more sense with Jim Clark having the SGI background and SGI making the shift for that now.
 Is there any tie between Lucasfilm and SGI?
 Oh, thats a good question.
 The University of Utah folks that ultimately became Industrial Light Magic.
 Jim Clark was one of those Utah folks.
 Along with of course Nolan Bushnell and Alan Kay?
 I think thats right.
 I dont know if there are any direct ties between Lucasfilm and SGI.
 Although Im sure they were using SGIs hardware for the effects at ILM, at Industrial Light Magic.
 It was Alan Kay who went to the University of Utah and graduated with his Masters in .
 So it would have been that same time as Nolan Bushnell.
 All this stuff going on.
 Later, were now in the very early s, young Ben coming out of school, coming out of his masters program, he joins SGI.
 He doesnt stay that long though.
 After about a year he leaves and he joins a startup thats coming out of SGI.
 And that startup kind of fails, but its his first startup experience, and then he moves on and he joins Lotus.
 Yes.
 What should have been the way that we all processed words and numbers, but alas, Microsoft crushed them.
 Yeah.
 What was it?
 Lotus I think?
 Yup, and Lotus Notes.
 Lotus Notes, yup.
 While Ben is at Lotus, he hears about this new exciting paradigm development.
 A new piece of software coming out of not Silicon Valley, but the middle of the country, the Midwest, the heartland of AmericaIllinois.
 We are talking about Mosaic, the Mosaic web browser.
 The NCSA Mosaic.
 Indeed.
 Wasnt it originally X Mosaic?
 Oh, I dont know that.
 Yeah, it was originally released as sort of a prototype piece of software originally only for Unix systems and used the X Windows System.
 It was a common thing to denote it with an X in the name of the piece of software.
 Wow.
 Well, were going to get into the name more in a minute here, but then heres about Mosaic and of course its celebrity wunderkind young brash founder, I guessMarc Andreessen.
 So who was Marc Andreessen?
 A man who needs no introduction.
 But his background was lets just say pretty different from the that Ben was growing up in.
 He was born in Cedar Falls, Iowa, which is not a super, super small town.
 But he was raised in New Lisbon, Wisconsin.
 Do you know what the population of New Lisbon, Wisconsin is today, Ben?
 Ten thousand?
 Two thousand five hundred and fiftyfour people.
 Marcs father, Lowell, was a sales manager for a seed company called the Pioneer HiBred International Seed Company, and his mother Pat, worked in customer service at Lands' End.
 I think they would go on to become a sizable customer of Loudcloud, but that is, in the future to come.
 Marc talks about this all the time.
 If youve heard Marc talk about his background, he could not wait to get out of this small town, the Midwest, and computers on the internet where the vehicle he was going to do it.
 He says of his family, which he rarely, rarely talks about.
 The one quote I was able to find is he says, They were Scandinavian hardcore, very selfdenying people who go through life never expecting to be happy.
 Wow.
 Its worth pointing out too that when you say this nontraditional background, you alluded to him as this wunderkind, and that was just not true yet.
 At this point in history, and we have Brian McCullough from the Internet History Podcast to thank for this.
 I binged the first episodes of that podcast to prep for this.
 But he brings up the point that Marc was like an hourly worker at NCSA.
 Oh yeah.
 He was getting paid .
 an hour.
 Yeah.
 No one recognizes his genius yet, and the innovation of creating Mosaic of actually mobilizing people to work on this thing was like, hey, we have a lot of fallow resources here.
 We have some smart people.
 I have no authority, but Im going to wrangle the troops to try and do this with me.
 I think if theres one thing that young Marc Andreessen and now older Marc Andreessen is very good at, it is putting himself in the right environment to meet the right people and to succeed.
 Were referring to the University of Illinois where he would end up going to college.
 He was very intentional about deciding that.
 He decided that he wanted to go to school, a to study computer science as we wanted to go to school with a great CS program that his family could afford and b he also wanted a place where he would have the opportunity not just to study CS, but to actually work while hes in school, on cool stuff thats going on.
 And of course, UrbanaChampaign had not just great a CS school, but what we were referred to a few times The National Center for Supercomputing Applications was attached to it, the NCSA.
 Marcwhen he gets to Illinoishe immediately starts doing workstudy at the NCSA and while hes there as you mentioned, hes not yet Marc Andreessen.
 How does he end up coming up with Mosaic?
 While hes at NCSA, theyre interfacing with all of the other supercomputing centers around the world including academic research like particle accelerators.
 Particularly, with CERN over in Switzerland, the particle accelerator, which is where Tim BernersLee is and thats where Tim BernersLee comes up with the set of Standards like HTTP and all that stuff that he dubs the world wide web.
 All the way across the world, halfway across the world in Illinois, this kid working there, Marc Andreessen hears about it and hes like, oh well, that sounds very interesting.
 Totally, its cool thinking about how this came to be because you got Tim BernersLee there on one of the few next workstations, like the next cube, that actually shipped and was actually used by people.
 Because this crazy expensive thing that only went to people working in academia.
 Of course, this is sort of Steve Jobs' company before returning to Apple.
 It says so much about Tim and the environment in which the internet and the World Wide Web was started that it was on the NeXT machine.
 It came out of this rigorous Academia corner of the world, which is frankly so different from a lot of the startup innovation that is happening today.
 I mean, a lot of the frontier tech stuff comes out of academic labs.
 But I think we often forget, especially with how its sort of countercultural, a lot of new things on the internet have become, that it started in a very A very closed way, honestly.
 The original intention behind all these sets of protocols and the World Wide Web was supposed to be just for universities and research.
 So they could share research notes.
 Yeah, and it was very controversial what Marc was doing because people didnt want to let the riffraff in.
 They thought it would dilute the quality of this is supposed to be a pure thing about conducting research.
 I got this great quote from Marc.
 He gave this in an interview in thats talking about starting Mosaic, and he says, But the internet community back then, the key technical people didnt want the internet to become easy to use or graphical because that would pollute the environment.
 Only smart people could use the internet was the theory, so we needed to keep it hard to use.
 We fundamentally disagree with that.
 We found it should be easy to use and graphical.
 So you should be able to point and click.
 Totally.
 Its so great.
 Its really just because of Marc.
 He doesnt give a crap.
 Hes getting paid .
 an hour over it Hes like, well, whats the worst that can happen?
 Ill just code this thing up.
 He convinces Eric Bina whos a fulltime employee there to work with him and code up an easytouse graphical browser to open this up to everybody.
 Theyll fire me if it doesnt work, who cares?
 This is the first playbook theme that I want to pull forward, and listeners who are trying something a little new today, interspersing more of the playbook throughout the story.
 But this is the very first time Marc runs the playbook of theres something right now, theres only for some small close group of people in an accessible way.
 I think theres something very interesting to be done by opening up to the masses.
 And of course, theres no business model behind this yet.
 It just lets everyone use the internet and lets make that possible.
 When you think about Andreessen Horowitz all these years later funding things like Clubhouse and investing in social media platforms like Twitter like Marc did very early.
 Or help Coinbase.
 Absolutely.
 It is very much this lets take something very esoteric, make it very available to everyone, and then we will figure it out later.
 This is the very first time he runs that playbook.
 The other counterintuitive thing or going against the grain element of building a massmarket browser for the web was that this was not how most people thought the internet was going to go at the time.
 At the time, this was in the early s, people were talking about the information superhighway.
 Actually, SGI was a big part of this.
 SGI was working with the cable companies to build these internetenabled settop boxes.
 Everyone thought it was going to be TVs.
 It was going to be TVs and even worse, it was going to be the cable companies and the government in a privatepublic partnership that owned all these pipes.
 Could you imagine?
 That they were going to control the stuff that was going to go on there, Americans were going to access it through their televisions.
 This was a big platform with the Clinton Administration when they were campaigning for the ' election was that we are going to be a big part of the information superhighway from the Federal Government.
 Its fascinating to zoom out a little bit.
 It makes sense that you have these big screens and you have fat bandwidth thats able to send perfect, not choppy, high fidelity audio and video to TVs.
 And then you look over at this internet thing, which is only a thing for academic institutions, theres nodes or something at all.
 There are servers on the whole internet and all it can do is send texts back and forth.
 No, youre not going to bet on that platform to be the way that this ends up coming to market.
 To be fair to the soontobe Clinton administration and in particular to Al Gore, who would become Vice President Gore.
 In the Gore Bill, which is allocating funding for all these various internet projects that are being built out in America.
 They actually specifically allocated funding to the Mosaic Project at the NCSA.
 This is how they get the resources to pay Marcs .
 an hour salary for all the hours that he and Eric are going to work on coding this thing up.
 See, youre telling me Al Gore did invent the internet.
 He did sort of.
 I guess he was like the VC who funded the internet?
 Wow, Al Gore was Marc Andreessens VC.
 You heard it here first.
 You heard it here first.
 They do this, they create Mosaic.
 In they opened it up for anyone to download and use for free.
 But importantly, this is going to come up again later.
 They do not open source the code.
 So the NCSA retains the code behind Mosaic.
 Its not free, available, and opensource, but anybody can download it and use it.
 Of course, people go nuts and do.
 In Wired would write, The Second Phase of the Revolution Has Begun.
 Dont look now, but Prodigy, AOL, and CompuServe are all suddenly obsolete and Mosaic is well on its way to becoming the worlds standard interface.
 Because those were all these walled gardens.
 Everyone should remember, AOL was not the internet.
 It was AOL keywords.
 It was pay to play.
 It was you could only publish the content on AOL if you did a deal with AOL, which is of course how they had these incredible revenues that they were reporting and everyone thought this was the most unbelievable company ever.
 But, the internet was fundamentally something different.
 The World Wide Web was something completely different.
 Open is probably not the right word yet but used standard protocols.
 When you mentioned that it grew like crazy, I grabbed some stats on that.
 In February of  when they released the first version, and this is super prototypey.
 There are some great comments from Marc Andreessen out on the NCSA X Mosaic listserv when they released version .
 in January of  that say things like, Im looking more for feedback on design and functionality than bug reports right now.
 Dont take the current code too seriously.
 New releases will probably come out every days until .
 arrives.
 The bulk of the program will be rewritten in C anyway.
 There are disclaimers all over the mailing list that hes distributing this thing out to, but the stats are crazy.
 Its like the early Ethereum.
 Totally.
 The next month, there were users in February of .
 Within weeks, theres and by springyou got January is that listserv, February is users, a month later its .
 By Spring, two months later after that, it had users, and then nine months later in early , it had a million users.
 The very first thing that Marc Andreessen shipped had insane growth and perfect productmarket fit right out the gate.
 Those were still pretty good numbers today.
 Absolutely.
 This is in an era when people maybe have a dialup connection, probably people have PCs, but not that many people.
 The TAM of the internet was super small.
 If you had a million people by early  using your software on the internet, I dont know what percent of internet users that is, but its meaningful.
 You had of all internet users.
 Totally.
 It was the killer app for the internet.
 This is funny.
 Were talking about this is also Marcs senior year at Illinois.
 He graduated in the Spring of probably when Mosaic was at the ish user adoption curb.
 He doesnt think this is going to be a thing.
 Hes like, oh, this is a cool thing I did as an internship during my college years.
 I want to move out to Silicon Valley, move out to California and get a job at a real computing company.
 Famously, he talks about this.
 He felt like he already missed it.
 He felt like Silicon Valley had happened.
 Absolutely.
 I got the quote for this too.
 Marc did a great interview with the Tim Ferriss Show a few years ago.
 He says, When I got to the Valley in , I thought I had missed the whole thing The great PC companies had gotten built in the s and s.
 And by the time the s arrived, the PC was done.
 It was finished, and you could go buy one, and it was great.
 But it was done.
 People in the Valley thought there was nothing else left to do.
 And then, there was this moment where I and various people wrapped our heads around the implication of the internet, which, today, seems obvious.
 But, at the time, it was very contrarian if you said the internet will become a mainstream consumer medium that billion people are going to use worldwide for all forms of human activity, you would have been laughed at.
 You would have been institutionalized.
 Spoken only as Marc Andreessen can.
 To insert a playbook theme here, this is always true.
 There is no moment in Silicon Valley writ large in tech where this is not true.
 I remember graduating from GSP in and commiserating with all of my friends being like, we missed it.
 Its over.
 The valuations are so high, its crazy.
 I felt like this after shipping apps to the Apps Store, then I was five or six hit, and suddenly there were a million apps.
 I was like, shoot, its over.
 Meanwhile, machine learning had yet to arrive, crypto had yet to arrive.
 Michael Moritz at Sequoia has a wonderful saying of this.
 I dont know that this is actually publically written anywhere, but this is the biggest lesson that he took from Sequoias Cisco investment, which he was looking at the returns at Cisco.
 He was like, how are we ever going to top this?
 This is the top.
 Well never do better.
 He was talking to Don Valentine about it and Don was like, its always going to be bigger.
 As long as Moores law continues, then the number and scale of industries that computing and technology can address are always going to grow as long as that is happening.
 The next generation is always going to be an order of magnitude bigger than this generation.
 That is played out time and time and time again.
 Of course, Moores law technically didnt continue, but the number of cores for the same price that you can put on a single system on a chip has followed the same trajectory as Moores law.
 Even when we hit the upper limit on certain things in Physics, the industry seems to figure out a way to continue to have the spirit of Moores law and the price and power of compute continue such that, this is another Andreessen saying, but at some point, the hardware limitations go away and compute becomes free.
 Then its really all about with an infinite and free resource of compute, what you can do with software?
 Yup.
 Back to Marc.
 He cant even get a job at a bigger respected PC or software company.
 He moves out in Palo Alto and he gets a job at Enterprise Integration Technologies, which I think was a tech implementation consulting firm doing PeopleSoft installations for companies.
 Sweet.
 You can imagine Marc Andreessens fit with an environment like this.
 Of course, as this is happening, this is when Mosaic is rocketing up this adoption curve.
 Its this weird thing where hes this kid out of school, working a noname job, but hes kind of a celebrity.
 Hes gotten kind of shoved out and there are two sides to this story.
 I think the folks in NCSA would say that Mosaic was an official project, Marc says they sort of selforganized.
 It became very clear to him that the bureaucratic leadership at the NCSA was going to take the lead on this and start doing the press interviews.
 They did own the license to the source code, so he was an employee and it became NCSAs thing, not Marc Andreessens thing.
 Yup, oh boy is that going to come back.
 Enter Jim Clark.
 Of course, Jim Clark, founder of Silicon Graphics, SGI, Utah Mafia Alumni.
 He had just left SGI, he had been feuding with the board and hes out.
 Hes looking for his next thing, but he has a nonsolicit from SGI so he cant take any of his people with him, but he knows he wants to start a new thing.
 Hes got a chip on his shoulder.
 Hes like, I got another act.
 Im going to prove all these people wrong.
 He needs to go find new blood.
 He hears about Mosaic, he tries it out, and hes like, this is amazing, this is the future.
 I got to look up this Marc Andreessen guy whos there on the about page.
 Its like Mosaic by Marc Andreessen.
 He cold calls him and they get together, they have breakfast.
 I think Marc would famously say this is the one and only time he got up at AM in his s.
 Heres how it goes down.
 They have breakfast and Jim was like, Marc, you should commercialize this thing that youre doing with Mosaic.
 You got to get out of this job and I think we should do it together.
 Marc was like, I dont know.
 Im really enjoying this consulting lifestyle, doing software implementation, PeopleSoft.
 hell no, let me get out of here.
 Lets go do this damn thing.
 No, thats not how it went down at all.
 You probably know this Ben from the research, but you would think that would be now, in retrospect, an obvious thing.
 No, Jim does take a shine to Marc and hes like, okay, great.
 I want you on my team in the new team I was assembling.
 I want some young blood, but the idea I have is this N Nintendo Console that weve been working with Nintendo over at Silicon Graphics.
 This is going to be the perfect information superhighway node into living rooms.
 This is how were going to win the internet.
 Were going to build an online service for the N console.
 It makes sense given the background, given the hype that was going around N at that time.
 I see why that was the belief.
 I remember being a yearold reading every single gaming magazine that would come out just trying to get details on the N.
 I got mine on launch day.
 I would have convinced my parents to pay any amount of money for an online service for that console.
 Which is so interesting that this is what they conceived of instead of the browser because this would go on to become a huge business.
 You look at Xbox Live three, four decades later, this becomes an enormous opportunity.
 But at that time, this would have been absolutely the wrong move and theres another playbook theme.
 Marc has a quote that says, If they had shipped a year earlier, referring to the N, we probably would have done that instead of Netscape.
 The history turns on knifepoint.
 The console gets delayed for a year and because of that, theyll never be able to reach a deal with Nintendo and its unclear that anythings going to happen.
 Meanwhile, theyre both itching to get a company going.
 They have a brainstorming session where theyre thinking of other ideas for stuff to do and eventually, Marc is like, okay, you know this Mosaic thing?
 I did build that and all my buddies that I did it with back in Illinois, theyre about to graduate too or they have already graduated.
 We can just go hire all of them, recreate it, and commercialize it.
 Jims like, okay, fine.
 Lets do it.
 They incorporate and they start the worldrenowned, going to be historymaking, Mosaic Communications Corporation to commercialize Mosaic.
 I love that they were like, yeah, well just use the same name.
 Well name our company Mosaic even though thats a thing thats owned by that lab at the university.
 Obviously, NCSA was not too happy with this.
 They threatened lawsuits all back and forth.
 Eventually, they changed the name to Netscape Communications, and that is how it came to be.
 It was actually Greg Sands who was the first PM that they hired.
 Greg Sands of Costanoa?
 Greg Sands of Costanoa, previously of Sutter Hill.
 Oh, awesome.
 Greg Sandss little sister Emily was at Princeton with me and Jenny and was Salutatorian of Jennys class.
 One of the absolute top five brilliant people Ive ever met in my life.
 They changed the name of the company to Netscape, but the internal code I was going to ask you if you knew this.
 Yes, the internal code name that they used and that they continued to refer to the actual browser code itself is Mozilla, which stands for Mosaic Killer.
 Its so good.
 Its so good.
 If you are wondering where Mozilla came from, thats it.
 Yup.
 Clark at this point in time, his network from SGI is around million or so.
 He puts in million.
 He finances the whole thing himself, hiring all these great people like Greg.
 Which by the way, his network was million from SGI not because that was a little company, but because he had to take on a colossal amount of financing on very onerous terms in order to make that company succeed.
 Totally.
 That he would walk away with million from SGI after decades.
 million and a chip on his shoulder.
 A huge chip on the shoulder.
 Hes wary of all these VCs that financed SGI.
 I think NEA was the big VC behind them and took so much equity.
 He puts in million, but then hes worried about well, this is really getting a lot of buzz, starting to take off.
 Were going to need more capital.
 I dont have enough to finance it myself.
 I guess I will bring on some venture capitalists.
 He goes and talks to his old buddies at NEA, but enters Kleiner Perkins and John Doerr hears about the deal and outbids NEA, invests million in the fledgling Netscape Communications Corporation for of the company, so post.
 Wow.
 Times were different back then.
 Not too long after that, Ben our erstwhile, steeped in hippie Berkeley, true Bay Area culture DNA friend Ben, hes overworking at Lotus at that time and he had heard about Mosaic of course.
 Hes been using it.
 He thinks this is the future.
 He hears all about this going on in Netscape and he was like, I got to get in there.
 I got to make it happen.
 He asks a friend, get him into the connection.
 He goes to the interviews, he gets the job, and he gets put in charge of the enterprise web server product line at Netscape.
 This is because there arent web servers yet, right?
 Whats the point of having a browser to load webpages if theres no software that can sit on servers that can create web pages?
 Exactly.
 This is going to become really big, but at that time, I dont know what Ben was feeling.
 Whether he was excited about this or not, but it was like, okay, this is how were going to make money.
 Were going to sell licenses for the server business so that companies can create websites and have commercial websites.
 The big sexy thing is this browser that is getting millions of people using it.
 Its this part of the company that was, yeah, necessary, this is how were going to make money.
 It is a beautiful timetested business model.
 Give away the consumer thing for free, get as many people on that as you possibly can.
 Its actually the first real example of aggregation theory.
 Netscape ends up becoming powerful in the ecosystem because they are able to get all the internet users using it, and thus, then apply pressure to businesses that if you want to create great websites, you can do so.
 We promise it will be compatible with Netscape, the browser that everyone uses, so you should buy these tools from us.
 It makes a lot of sense.
 Really, I think it only came about because of the history of Mosaic being part of NCSA.
 If some company like Microsoft were to otherwise have gone out and created a new piece of software like they did with Word, Excel, or PowerPoint that they bought.
 Consumer licenses.
 Yeah, the natural thing to do.
 You put it in a box, you put it in a CD, you shrink wrap it, you get it to CompUSA, and you would sell that sucker for to every consumer that walked through the door.
 Not the route that the browser took to its great advantage.
 Which is fascinating because that affected everything henceforth.
 Ive never paid for a web browser.
 You can make an argument that people are paying for Brave in different ways or certain people are paying for specialized browsers, but it sets the trend that you do not pay to get access to the web.
 Yeah, totally.
 Famously, people at Netscape would talk about how we invented internet time, and that it was this parallel universe that was accelerating faster than reality time.
 By August were just months after the company started.
 In April .
 In April , Netscape had an market share of web browsers in the world and they decidedJim Clark pushes themthat theyre going to go public.
 And they successfully killed Mosaic at this point, .
 Just months ago, the other thing that Marc Andreessen created had close to of the market share, which is wild.
 It turns out they havent totally killed Mosaic.
 Sixteen months youre talking from founding to IPO, like any good tech company.
 Like any good tech company.
 The bankers, Morgan Stanley, Frank Quattrone, and Mary Meeker on the analyst side have taken them public.
 Just absolute killers.
 Killer superstar.
 Frank Quattrone of the Amazon IPO.
 Mary Meeker of Bond Capital and famously the Kleiner Perkins state of the internet.
 Yup.
 The people who would go on to do unbelievable things took this company public.
 Totally.
 Theyre not quite sure how to price that.
 Nothing like this has ever happened before, so they decided theyre supposed to price at a share.
 I didnt do the exact math, but that would be roughly million or million market cap, shall we say.
 Astronomical at that time.
 I mean, months ago this was a postSeries A that Kleiner did.
 Theyre thinking a share the night before.
 Clarkremember hes pretty salty when he walked away at SGIpushes them to up the IPO price from what they ended up pricing at the night before to a share.
 The next day, the stock doesnt open because there is so much buzz about this company.
 Obviously, the institutional demand is high and famously, institutional investors were kicking themselves for having missed out on Microsoft a decade earlier and how big that became, so the hype is this can be the next platform.
 This can be the next Microsoft.
 Meanwhile, theyve got millions of people like moms and pops, and kids using this thing on their home PCs.
 They all hear in the news that Netscape is going public, theyre using Netscape, they want retail on sale on the IPO.
 Youre telling me theres going to be a POP?
 This is like the origin of the POP, the IPO POP, earlystage three IPO POP.
 Famously, Charles Schwab, the brokerage, had to change their phone systems leading up to the IPO because remember, there are no internet brokerages at this point.
 You cant place orders online even through Netscape.
 They changed their phone system so that when you called your broker at Charles Schwab, you would get a message in the couple of days leading to the Netscape IPO that said, Welcome to Charles Schwab.
 If youre interested in the Netscape IPO, press one.
 There is so much demand it takes hours to open up the stock on the day of the IPO.
 It opens at a share.
 Wow.
 The bankers were like, I dont know that we can go up to the night before.
 They thought they were going to price it at the bankers reluctantly IPOed it at then the first retail trade happens at ?
 Seventyfive, yup.
 It falls a little bit during the day but it closes at a share giving the company a billion market cap.
 Just insane.
 Totally insane.
 I think Microsoft was about billion at this point in time, if I remember it right.
 Its worth saying a few things.
 One, this absolutely kicked off the dotcom bubble.
 This was the moment that it started.
 There were a couple of internet IPOs before this, but this is the one that blew the doors wide open, made valuations not matter, and created years of absolute madness from this point forward.
 But Netscape had an unbelievable growth trajectory, not just in users, but in revenue.
 In the Ben Horowitz corner of the business, revenues were doubling every quarter, which means they were Xing revenue year over year.
 Theyve only been around for five quarters.
 Sure.
 But a X year over year run rate on revenue?
 They did million in revenue in the first six months of alone, which for a company that entered being eight, nine months old and then was doing run rate million, million revenue in that first full year of existence, that is very impressive.
 Yeah, for sure.
 The other thing thats worth mentioning here is that it was unusual for companies at this point in time to IPO without being profitable.
 Bankers were making this exception of, this one is going to be hot even though the company is not profitable.
 Whereas now you look around and its absolutely the minority of the time that a company is profitable before the public is willing to take on the risk of continuing to finance that company.
 Its just funny how much things have changed.
 Netscape IPO, this was a cultural moment for tech, for the world, for finance, for everything Funny story.
 This was only six days before the launch of Windows so this is the most interesting month ever in the tech industry to this point.
 This must have been on the risk factor of the IPO prospectus, I didnt look it up.
 But if theres one bear narrative on the Netscape IPO, its Microsoft.
 Everybody knows Microsoft controls Windows.
 They control the operating system of of the install base of PCs in America, in the world at that point in time.
 What are they going to do?
 But nobody pays too much attention and famously, shout out to Brian McCullough for finding this and calling it out.
 Around the IPO, Marc gives an interview and says famously that when hes asked if hes worried about Microsoft competing and he says, Im not worried about it.
 Netscape can become a company that will turn Windows into a mundane collection of not entirely debugged device drivers.
 Well, pride comes before the fall as we all know.
 Obviously, this is Microsoft in the s, which is an absolute killer.
 PreDOJ.
 PreDOJ, which happens because of all of this.
 In May of that year, Bill Gates saw this happening.
 He saw Netscape, he saw where this was going to go.
 In May of , he had written the internal internet tidal wave memo.
 For anybody who hasnt read that, it is just worth reading in its entirety to understand the genius of Bill Gates, but to understand the context of that time.
 Even Bill Gates, even Microsoft who was so steeped in this stuff, their strategy was the information superhighway.
 They were long all this stuffinteractive TVbut they just like most other people did not predict that this lowend disruptor the internetbased on text being sent over HTTP and images, in line that Marc Andreessen managed to get into the browser too.
 That that actually was going to be the thing.
 Its not until early when he pens that memo where it becomes obvious even to the smartest, wellpositioned people in the whole tech industry to react to this.
 Once he realizes and writes that memo, oh boy, is it ever game on.
 Guns out.
 This is a strategic priority, number one of the company.
 Were going to compete here and were going to win.
 It turns out, they actually have the perfect strategy to kill Netscape already in progress within Microsoft.
 Which is that back in Thomas Reardona famous Microsoft employee and then would go on to be a founder of CTRLlabs, which Facebook acquired a couple of years agowas playing around.
 He thought browsers were interesting, this is going to be a thing.
 He had licensed for Microsoft some code for a browser from a little company called Spyglass, Inc.
, which happened to be located in Illinois in Urbana, Champaign.
 Why was it located in Urbana, Champaign?
 Because it was the commercial entity started by the university to spin out and commercialize the IP that they developed at the NCSA including the Mosaic web browser.
 Microsoft has got a license to the Mosaic web browser.
 Theyre like, well, we got this license, we can use it.
 The terms of the license are actually that we pay Spyglass a portion of the revenues that we make for distributing this thing.
 What if we just bundle it to Windows and we give it to everybody for free?
 Oh my God, stonecold killers.
 There actually ends up being a big lawsuit about this.
 Spyglass sues Microsoft and is like hey, youre giving this away to hundreds of millions of people and youre not paying us anything because youre not charging for it.
 Classic Microsoft, legally theyre like, hey, we savvily negotiated an agreement with you.
 Sorry, its your fault that you didnt anticipate the way that we would go on to distribute this thing.
 Famously, they ran this playbook and have done the same thing with DOS back in the day.
 This is worthy of a quick sidebar because this is absolutely unbelievable and is part of the reason Microsoft got sued.
 But Microsoft had a deal in place where in order to use DOS at all, to license DOS from them.
 If youre an OEM making computers, you had to pay them whether or not you chose to use DOS as the operating system on that PC.
 It was a per CPU shipped license.
 If youre a PC manufacturer, in order to get access to DOS, Microsoft is like, sure, well license it to you, but were not tying the amount of money that you owe us to the amount of computers with Windows on it.
 Its the amount of CPU you ship.
 Then, of course, the incentive there is for the OEM to say, well we got to make the most of this license since were going to be charged for it anyway.
 They put Windows on everything they shipped and that is how Microsoft became the dominant platform with DOS where then every application became written on top of DOS because every CPU had DOS on it.
 Famously, Microsoft did not develop DOS.
 They did a very similar deal, they licensed it.
 From another Seattle company.
 Another story for another day.
 God, they were killers.
 The net of it is even after the lawsuit, they pay a grand total Microsoft does of million to Spyglass, which goes back to the University of Illinois.
 The NCSA and University of Illinois get million for Mosaic, which becomes Internet Explorer.
 Thats right, Mosaic, which Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina wrote at NCSA, the IP stays at NCSA in Illinois, spun out into Spyglass, licensed from Microsoft, that is Internet Explorer.
 For anyone who is thinking, geez, how did Internet Explorer launch so quickly after Microsoft needed to catch up and needed to create a browser, this is how it did it.
 People know that this is happening and Netscape knows that this is going on.
 Meanwhile, Netscape at this point is helmed joining before the IPO was a new CEO, Jim Barksdale.
 They brought in a professional CEO operator.
 He was the former COO of FedEx.
 He came from McCaw Cellular and ATT before that.
 They have this grizzled industry veteran at this point because even Jim Clarkfor all of his executiveness from SGIbefore the IPO Netscape, actually did want this robust professional public markets CEO.
 Everybody knows this is going on, but Netscape thinks and the market thinks that okay, Microsoft got this Internet Explorer thing, they licensed it to Mosaic.
 Theyre going to run the Office playbook here.
 Theyre going to sell this at CompUSA and youre going to buy it.
 As you said Ben, two weeks after the Netscape IPO, they launched Windows and not fully bundled in then, but they say theres Windows pack and Internet Explorer is bundled into it for free.
 Of course, this would eventually, very quickly, Internet Explorer would just be directly bundled to every copy of Windows and then Windows XP.
 All of a sudden, Netscape is now forced to compete with free and bundled like every operating system basically on the planet.
 Absolutely brutal.
 Totally brutal.
 Now, this little division that Ben Horowitz is running, the enterprise server division, becomes hugely more important.
 This is the only part of the company where they can even conceivably compete against Microsoft, and this becomes a major strategic initiative in Netscape.
 Were going to focus on enterprise server products.
 Of course, the enterprise server products have to produce web pages that are compatible with Internet Explorer because that is now what everybody is using.
 It sucks.
 Its so brutal.
 Famously, Ben and the team start scrambling.
 Theyre going to make the product way better than the Microsoft product.
 Theyre working on a bunch of new features.
 They lined up a big announcement event in New York City for March of about the new version of the product.
 And famously, two weeks before the event, Marc ends up giving an interview to Computer Reseller News of all publications where he just reveals the whole thing.
 Ben sends an email to Marc.
 The email says one line, I guess were not going to wait until the th to launch the strategy.
 The email was from Ben just to Marc.
 Marc responds, copies in Jim Clark, copies in Jim Barksdale, and says, Apparently, you do not understand how serious the situation is.
 We are getting killed killed killed out there.
 Our current product is radically worse than the competition.
 Competition being Microsoft.
 Weve had nothing to say for months.
 As a result, weve lost over B in market capitalization.
 We are now in danger of losing the entire company and its all server product managements fault.
 Next time do the interview yourself.
 F You, Marc.
 Reading this email in printand of course, were being familyfriendly here on the air, but just saying F You, Marc.
 I just cant imagine sliding an email that way.
 Heres the best part.
 That email was written the very same day that the Time Magazine cover came out.
 The Barefoot, no way.
 The Barefoot.
 Marc Andreessen on the cover of Time Magazine barefoot on a throne as the throne of the next new Silicon Valley King.
 Marc would later say about this whole escapade, this is why I should not run a company.
 No kidding.
 Maybe you should be a venture capitalist instead.
 Thats actually a good question.
 In Marcs entire career, including the Loudcloud story that were going to go on to tell later, has Marc ever been the CEO of a company?
 I dont know.
 Was he the CEO of Ning?
 He was the CEO of Ning, youre right.
 Okay, so once.
 Well get to that.
 Its very interesting that of all the biggest successes, he was either effectively the cofounding CTO, a board member, or the venture capitalist behind it and not the CEO of any of the most successful stuff hes done.
 This is going to be great I dont want to say a lie because its not a lie, but the posturing from one of the key elements at the beginning of Andreessen Horowitz, which was their motto that all the general partners here need to have been CEOs.
 But half of the first five or six general partners have never been CEOs.
 Right.
 Theres a lot of credibility behind that they were strong operational leaders, executives, but yeah, its a good point.
 Absolutely.
 Jeff Jordan led the PayPal acquisition and ran PayPal within eBay.
 He was not the CEO of eBay, but I would take him on my board.
 But yeah, thats funny.
 I think this is a good point.
 Before we get into the ', ', ' continuation of the browser wars and what happens to Netscapeand Ill leave it there for the momentthis is a great time to announce our second sponsor of this season of Acquired.
 We are very excited to welcome PitchBook to the show.
 As many if not all of you know, PitchBook is the leading financial data provider for VC, private equity, and all mergers and acquisitions.
 Their platform includes a database with information on more than .
 million companies and over .
 million deals.
 Im going to deviate from the script here and just say it is so comprehensive.
 There is no better, more broad coverage data source of private company data and a lot of public company data out there.
 Ill tell you, they definitely dont sacrifice quality for quantity because of their clients rate PitchBooks coverage of private company data as better than any other data provider.
 We also do want to tell you, we use PitchBook all the time for the podcast.
 It is a huge part of how we research and how we do our homework for episodes.
 Were able to share these precise details like pre and postrounds share price, shareholder equity, and who owns what throughout the story because of PitchBook.
 This has been true for years.
 If only Jim Clark had it back in the SGI days, maybe he wouldnt have gotten diluted so much in his negotiations.
 So true.
 Im thinking back to our Uber episode where we were telling the share price along all the different years as it was getting funded.
 That was all from data we pulled from PitchBook.
 Listeners, we do have a special offer for you.
 You can explore PitchBooks database first hand by signing up to get limited access.
 You can get free access to the largest database of private market intel for two weeks to steep yourself, see what were talking about, and see for yourself.
 You can visit pitchbook.
comacquired to take advantage of that, or click the link in the show notes to see how PitchBook can help you.
 All right, David, were in the browser wars.
 Microsoft just blew Netscape out of the water.
 Whats going on for Netscape now?
 Such a tragedy.
 That year of the IPO in this actually was a really great companyNetscape did million in revenue in .
 Then, in it did million in revenue.
 Then million the next year in .
 People love to dunk on this now as IPO mania, unprofitable, blah blah blah tech bubble.
 It was for real.
 Once the Microsoft bundling strategy became obvious here in December 'which is when they announced that it was going to be bundled into all copies of Windows going forwardthe stock had peaked then at a share, which is even hugely up from where the IPO was.
 But it never got above that.
 It was just straight downhill from there, unfortunately.
 In finally, famously, Netscape sells itself to AOL for .
 billion, but its an allstock deal with AOL.
 Thats preTime Warner merger.
 Who knows by the time shareholders actually ultimately got liquid on that, what they were able to get out.
 Marc Andreessen, as part of the sale, became CTO of AOL.
 You can imagine how well thats going to work out.
 The funny thing is hes not actually responsible for any daytoday operations.
 Hes like the chief futurist at AOL.
 I think his role is forwardlooking technologies or something like that.
 He only lasts until September of ' right ahead of the Time Warner deal.
 Hes like, yeah, I want no part of this and leaves before that.
 Yeah.
 Oh, wow.
 I didnt realize he didnt even stay a year.
 I wonder if he forfeited some earnouts.
 Or maybe he was just like, the stock is going to be worthless soon anyway.
 Im out.
 Ben though, this is going to become very interesting.
 Actually, this deal becomes huge for the next chapter and ultimately, for Andreessen Horowitz the firm.
 Ben becomes the VP of AOLs ecommerce division.
 What he ends up doing is him and pretty much the whole old server team from Netscape, what he figures out is what they ultimately are tasked with doing are all of the brands that are trying to sell on AOL within the AOL walled gardenthis is Nike, this is LLB, and this is Lands' End.
 Were talking about all these retailers and CPG companies.
 They want to sell, but theyre not Internet companies.
 They dont have ecommerce apps, servers, and all the infrastructure that they need to make this happen.
 AOL can help them, but they got to go stand up like servers and data centers for all of these customers.
 Thats what Bens team ends up doing.
 Quickly, he realizes theres actually an opportunity here.
 AOL is going to do this for their partners selling on AOL.
 Which again, is not the internet or at least is not the web.
 Yeah.
 Its the internet, but not the web.
 I know that this is where the whole market is and is going to be in the future.
 These companies, Nike, et cetera, are going to need help doing the same thing for their web applications.
 Why dont we go start a company where we can operate this infrastructure for all these companies that are not technology companies?
 Then, they can just host their websites and their web applications on our infrastructure like a cloud of internet infrastructure that you can just deploy your applications to.
 You can dynamically spin up and spin down these virtual machines, David, so not even like owning your own server, but having virtualization across multiple servers that scale elastically as you need them.
 Yeah.
 This is a big idea, right, Ben?
 Wow.
 In ', that feels a little ahead of their time.
 Maybe a little ahead of their time.
 But they like the idea so much that they moved back to Silicon Valley.
 They leave DC where AOL was based.
 Actually, I dont know if they ever moved there or stayed in Silicon Valley.
 But they left AOL and they started the company.
 They really want to embrace this cloud concept that theyre pioneering.
 They call it Loudcloud.
 I cant wait to get into this.
 I do want to close the loop on a couple of Netscape things though before we move into the Loudcloud chapter.
 I was wondering, first of all, why did AOL buy Netscape?
 If theyre getting wrecked by Microsoft, why are they giving .
 billion of their stock?
 Is it because they knew their stock was wildly overvalued?
 Lets say its X overvalued, whats million of actual value to go and pick this company up?
 Which is what we now know about the way that they were motivated to do the Time Warner deal to basically do a stock swap for a company whose stock they felt actually had real intrinsic value.
 It makes a lot of sense that they would wildly overpay for this pseudodefunct Netscape even if all they got was the people and some technology behind it.
 Thats one explanation.
 The other would be basically to get a bargaining chip against Microsoft in case it became relevant for them to try and be less dependent on IE to have a browser of their own that they could bundle in and distribute.
 There are other people who believe that AOL was interested in Netcenter, which is basically Netscapes web properties which drew a lot of the traffic.
 Its like the MSN play that Microsoft had to be the destination website.
 Those are the reasons why AOL could have been willing to part with .
 billion of their stock to do this.
 If you trace it all the way through to today, I really have been trying to figure out what happened to the Netscape brand and what happened to the Netscape IP?
 The brand is an easy one to trace.
 That stayed with AOL until they ultimately were bought by Verizon.
 The big red checkmark Verizon owns the Netscape brand today.
 But somewhere along the line, the brand actually got separated from the technology, the bundle of all the intellectual property and everything that Netscape was, which did need a new name because they couldnt use the Netscape name anymore because that brand was owned by Verizon.
 That got renamed to the New Aurora Corporation, which AOL sold to Microsoft, who then, in turn, sold them again towait for it, DavidFacebook.
 Oh, yes.
 Oh my gosh, Im so glad you found this.
 This is from James Zawinski or jwz who was an early employee, pseudofounder.
 I think many credited him with being a founder of Netscape.
 He has this great blog and this crazy bar and concert venue in San Francisco called the DNA Lounge.
 He writes, The former Netscape company is currently a nonoperating subsidiary of Facebook, still known as the New Aurora Corporation.
 The Netscape brand remained with AOL.
 How crazy is that?
 Thats so crazy.
 Im so glad you paused us because theres another thing we got to talk about coming out of the Netscape.
 Mozilla.
 Mozilla, of course.
 I didnt realize this actually happened before the AOL acquisition.
 They were opensourced in I believe.
 But yeah, youre right.
 Before AOL, they opensourced all the browser code.
 Ironically, its so interesting that Mozillathe code name of the Mosaic killerended up becoming the name of the foundation that ended up stewarding the opensource code project, which of course then created Firefox.
 Out of the ashes of the duplicatedwithout ever looking at the codeNetscape, which came from Mosaic, you then have Mozilla.
 They did name the browser Mozilla for a while and had a separate browser called Mozilla, which was compiled from similar source code, and then Firefox.
 Which was a whole new thing, right?
 There was some code in common with the original Netscape browser.
 But it was very different.
 Firefox, when it first launched I remember this, had the search bar in the browser which was a concept they borrowed from Opera, but that was not in Netscape.
 Correct.
 It was in the top right.
 It wasnt the omnibar that Chrome pioneered.
 It was that separate search window.
 But it makes sense to me now, knowing all this lineage, why user agents have always been such a mess.
 This is going to date me, but if youve ever written raw HTML code and needed to do a user agent check because you need to figure out if its IE and you need to account for some three stupid pixels offset that they have that shouldnt actually be in there but the rendering engine sucks because its licensed from whatever old Mosaic thing, thats actually an unfair criticism.
 The real reason why it sucks is because they had such a dominant market share that Microsoft could do whatever they wanted, deviate from spec, and just say, everybodys using our stuff anyway.
 Who cares what the World Wide Web Consortium says it should do?
 The truth is what we say it is.
 Anyway, if you ever do these user agent checks on the strings, it has every browser name under the sun listed.
 If youre doing a string search, youre looking and youre like, what is this MozillaFirefoxNetscapeblah blah blah?
 Its because it all comes from the same original branch.
 All these different browsers are competing against each other, but there are only two major lineages.
 There is the Mosaic lineage and then all those engineers left.
 Without looking back at the old code, they wrote a new code called Mozilla.
 Everything is basically either from Mosaic or Mozilla.
 There have been different stuff over the years with WebKit and I dont know where Opera is derived from, but its amazing how much of the browser market share over time really just comes from those two.
 Yeah.
 It all still funnels through to today, which is crazy.
 Its so fun to actually have the right excuse now to be able to tell this whole story on Acquired.
 It always felt like there was a point in Acquireds life where we would have done a whole episode on Netscape, but now its like, I dont know what we can do.
 This is the perfect vehicle.
 Im so glad to do it.
 Totally.
 Thank God for the lessons of Netscape and Loudcloud, which were about to go into.
 Became the ashes upon which the phoenix of a landscapechanging venture firm would come from is the way they excuse.
 The Firefox of venture firms, shall we say?
 Honestly though, after the financial crash and all the funding, its not crazy to call it a Firefox, a phoenix, or whatever in founding a venture firm in and deploying capital the way they did.
 Im jumping ahead.
 I know well get there.
 Absolutely.
 If you want to be really nerdy, you could call it the Thunderbird of venture firms.
 I used to use Thunderbird.
 I thought it was great.
 Back to the story, Ben and his server team have realized this market opportunity.
 Theyve got this idea for cloud computing, cloud infrastructure.
 He hooks up with two of his core team, Tim Howes and Sik Rhee.
 They leave AOL.
 They go back to Silicon Valley.
 Theyre like, were doing this.
 Its still .
 The bubble is still quite inflated at this point.
 There is a lot of hype.
 And everyones drunk.
 Netscape IPOed with great revenues and great growth, but now everyones just drunk.
 Yes.
 Immediately, they want to get Marc involved.
 Of course, who wouldnt want Marc Andreessen involved in something like this?
 Marc totally gets it.
 Hes like, yeah, this is a big idea.
 Actually, this is amazing.
 At the press briefing for the launch of the Loudcloud, Marc would be there.
 In trying to describe what this cloud infrastructure concept is, he would use the very same electricity metaphor that Bezos would then use eight years later describing AWS at the YC event.
 What is the metaphor?
 Bezoss analogy that he used was German beer distilleries used to produce their own electricity to mash the hops and everything and do what theyre doing in the distilleries.
 Then, they hooked up to the grid and just used electricity from the grid.
 That innovation they realized is that electricity doesnt make the beer taste any better.
 Theres no reason why they should create electricity.
 The whole idea of cloud infrastructure is the same thing.
 Renting your infrastructure from Loudcloud, Amazon, Azure, or Google doesnt make your beer taste any better if youre an application provider.
 Marc was the first one to use this, so of course, they want to get him involved.
 But remember, Marc has learned at this point that he shouldnt run companies.
 Although I guess he made that mistake with Ning later.
 Marc says, I dont want to be an active cofounder, but Ill be Chairman and Ill invest million.
 I guess he was able to get enough money out of the AOL stock that he can invest million.
 Ben and the team go out to raise venture money on top of this and they meet Andy Rachleff at Benchmark Capital who they just love.
 Ben in The Hard Thing About Hard Things, a quote that he has describing Andy.
 He says, If I had to describe Andy with one word, it would be gentleman.
 The relationship between him, Ben, and Marc is deep and continues to be deep to this day.
 Andy, of course, was Benchmarks infrastructure guy.
 He started as a telecom investor, so this is completely in his wheelhouse and he gets it.
 This is where things get a little murky.
 No doubt this scene is one of the major seeds of Andreessen Horowitz and the firms whole philosophy.
 It would get sewn right here.
 I dont know exactly how it went down.
 I dont think anybodys ever given the whole story, but this is as best as we can reconstruct it.
 Well have to just have the protagonists on for a kumbaya one day.
 Obviously, this was a super hot deal.
 Netscape had failed, but like you said, Ben, everybody was drunk at this point in time.
 Somehow, I believe that Andy and Benchmark agreed to do the deal without a full partner meeting.
 They agreed to do it for a very high price even at the time, which was a million premoney valuation and Benchmark is going to invest million in the company.
 Its a big check for them.
 Are they even doing their million funds at this point?
 Probably around that.
 No.
 I think this was before their billiondollar fund, which famously they said theyll never repeat.
 I think their funds were maybe million, million at this point in time.
 Big check, big valuation, a brandnew company, and no partner meeting.
 At least as far as I can tell.
 The deal is going down and the Benchmark partnership though doesnt like that Marc is investing so much personally.
 Hes not an actively involved cofounder.
 Hes investing million.
 Heres the thing.
 The price of the deal is based on a premoney valuation because venture dealsuntil the last five, six, seven yearsall used to be priced on a premoney valuation.
 Now, the problem with a pre money valuation Nobody knows what they actually own until you specify exactly how much is being raised.
 Exactly.
 If more money gets raised, then youre going to own less of the company because the postmoney valuation goes up based on the amount of money raised.
 Benchmark is writing this huge check.
 They want to get divided by .
 They dont want to be the only money into the round.
 Then they should have specified the post, David.
 They should have specified the post, but people didnt do that back in the day.
 Heres Marc coming in now.
 Hes pumping the valuation up by million and hes coming in.
 They tried to cut Marc out of the round.
 That was wrong move number one.
 You dont really want to cross Marc Andreessen.
 Even if we just stopped the episode there and say, lets look at this from a singleturn game versus multiturn or iterated game, massive, massive bad idea for Benchmark to contribute to creating Andreessen Horowitz in the future.
 Sure, it could have been the most valuable thing to do for this deal at that moment, but for the next years, it would be a great benchmark if Andreessen Horowitz didnt exist.
 Not only if Andreessen Horowitz didnt exist, but if Ben and Marc were part of the Benchmark family.
 Totally.
 Thats an even better point.
 Creating a little bit of a friction point here, assuming that that is any factor contributing to going on to create their own venture firm.
 Well, that wasnt the only part.
 It gets worse.
 Supposedly, after the deal is done and closed, Marc of course is like, F You.
 Im putting my million in.
 Do you think youre going to come between me and Ben?
 Weve been through thisitd be like Benchmark trying to come between you and me.
 Thats not going to happen.
 Marc invests the million.
 Its a million postmoney valuation.
 Benchmark only gets .
 ownership after the deal is done.
 This is why I think they didnt present the whole partnership before the deal was done.
 Because Ben, Marc, and the whole leadership team of Loudcloud, of this new company, come in to meet the full Benchmark partnership.
 I think they only really knew Andy at this point.
 They come in.
 Its supposed to be like a slap on the back, get to know you.
 Oh, this is great, youre our VC firm.
 Hey, that was weird with Marc, but well get over it.
 Supposedly, in this meeting, David Byrne, who was then one of the GPs at Benchmark and had been a very successful executive recruiter before joining Benchmark as a GP.
 Ben is presenting.
 The whole management team is there.
 He says to Ben in front of everyone, hey, just stop.
 When are you going to get a real CEO?
 Ben is like, what do you mean?
 He knows what David means here, but hes trying to be like, hey, this is a friendly meeting.
 Lets not break out the knives yet.
 In front of the management team.
 In front of the management team and Marc.
 That just pulls out the rug underneath his ability to lead these people to do that.
 Yeah.
 Apparently then, Byrne just doubles down again and keeps attacking Ben.
 Hes like, youre not qualified to lead this company.
 How are you going to take this thing public, all of this stuff?
 Which also is ridiculous because of course, Ben is qualified to lead this company.
 Even if he werent, why on earth would you say this?
 He was doubling revenue quarter over quarter at Netscape in his division.
 On top of all of that, Marc Andreessen threw million in.
 He kind of needs you, but doesnt really need you.
 And youve already committed.
 Just do the valuecreating activity of giving the leadership team the confidence in their leader at this point.
 Totally.
 This creates, as you can imagine, an intense dislike between Ben and Marc and all of the Benchmark partnership except for Andy because I guess nobody else really stepped up to defend them here.
 We will later, in part two, get to the amazing profile that Tad Friend did in The New Yorker of Marc Andreessen in .
 But years later, there are these great quotes in there.
 Ben says about the whole philosophy of Andreessen.
 He says, We were always the antiBenchmark.
 Our design was not to do what they did.
 Hes talking about this.
 Then, Marc says about Bill Gurleythe most visible Benchmark partner at the timeI cant stand him.
 If youve seen 'Seinfeld,' Bill Gurley is my NewmanJerrys bte noire.
 This is something that you definitely have to know about Andreessen Horowitz, especially in their early days when they were starting.
 They were loud about being different.
 They wanted to position themselves in every way we possibly can, we are the opposite of your classic venture capital firm personified by Benchmark.
 Were going to get into this in part two, but its so great because that is the exact same playbook that Benchmark took against Kleiner Perkins when they started.
 Its fascinating.
 Its such a good strategy.
 Who was the architect of that strategy?
 Andy Rachleff.
 Who is the one Benchmark partner that they love?
 Andy Rachleff.
 Andy would then retire from Benchmark not long after.
 And the ties here end up actually running deep.
 Eric Vishria who was a Loudcloud exec would go on to become a fantastic partner at Benchmark.
 Heres the funny thing about all of it.
 This is so great.
 Its such a drama.
 I really do think that this experience was a big part of what planted the seed for Ben and Marc to start Andreessen Horowitz.
 All of this drama is just great for everybody.
 Its great for Andreessen.
 Its great for a Benchmark.
 No press is bad press.
 The more that people are talking about and writing about this as Andreessen Horowitz is getting off the ground, the more it just increases the stature of both firms.
 Yeah.
 The piece youre talking about is literally called Tomorrows Advance Man about Marc Andreessen.
 Thats the one youre mentioning, right?
 Yeah.
 That is the puff piece of puff pieces.
 Its a great analytical piece.
 But its like, hey, youre the best futurist in the world.
 Say whatever you want.
 Having a platform to be able to do any of this stuff, Marc takes full advantage.
 Oh, totally.
 Its so smart.
 All of this drama around the funding aside, nonetheless, people are still jazzed about Loudcloud.
 Two months after Series A, there is another million.
 Wired runs an article calling Loudcloud Marc Andreessens second coming, but then the clock starts to run out.
 Its also crazy that the press cant get enough of Marc Andreessen.
 Ben Horowitz is running the company, but Marc is like this Internet King narrative that everyone just wants to keep perpetuating, which is true in many ways, but its just interesting that he was not the CEO of either of those companies.
 Yes, but he was on the cover of Time Magazine on a throne.
 Heres the thing though about Loudcloud which is very different from Netscape.
 Its not a software company, its an infrastructure company.
 The thing about an infrastructure company about what theyre doing is that if you want to grow, if you want to take on more customers, you got to go lease some more data centers and you got to go Buy some more servers, rack them Rack them and stack them.
 It sounds like Capex to me, David.
 That sounds like a lot of CapEx.
 As theyre raising all this money, theyre investing forward in all this CapEx and theyre getting orders in.
 Pets.
com is like oh, yeah, Im thrilled to get some of this infrastructure.
 Then, in early of course, in March the bubble starts to deflate.
 A lot of these orders start vaporizing, but they have forward contracts to buy all this CapEx.
 They need money even though they just raised million.
 They go aroundthis is such a great moment.
 Theyre trying to raise money from everyone and all the VCs are spooked at whats going on.
 Theyre literally traveling around the world.
 They go to SoftBank.
 I dont know if they actually fly to Japan or if they meet with SoftBank in the US.
 I had no idea.
 They meet with Masa.
 This is great.
 Bill Campbell, the legendary coach, is by this point in time on the board of Loudcloud.
 Masa backchannels Bill and says, this is in The Hard Thing About Hard Things.
 Ben is like, Bill, how did it go with Masa?
 Bills like, honestly, he thought you were smoking crack.
 You know its bad even when hes like, this is crazy.
 Eventually, they do raise a Series C of million at a post, but its by the skin of their teeth.
 This is in the mid.
 They still burn through all that quickly and are once again on the brink by the beginning of .
 The only crazy lastditch potential financing option available to them is to try and go public because weirdly, there were still some believers in the public markets, even though all the VCs and private investors at this point were like, oh boy, we dont be funding any of these money burning companies.
 In March of they actually went public at a share and the Wall Street Journal ran a piece leading up to the IPO.
 Its called the IPO From Hell.
 I think it might have been either referenced in the piece or the title of the piece, everybodys calling this the IPO From Hell.
 They have a quote from Dick Kramlich at NEA saying, This is what we call a Hail Mary deal.
 You throw it up in the air, and you hope for the best.
 Oh my God.
 You know thats not good.
 Immediately after the IPO, which they did get done, they lowered their guidance.
 Its a great thing to be doing in your first quarter as a public company.
 Totally.
 The stock dropped by to a share and Goldman and MorganStanley had a book run IPO, they dropped research coverage on the company.
 No way.
 Before even one quarter is done, amazing.
 Whats the logic there?
 Its just expensive to have analysts covering your company and theyre like, look, we just dont believe in the company anymore even though we underwrote it, so were going to stop paying analysts to do this work?
 Thats a good question.
 It could be that or I wonder if its more that if we were to cover this company, we would say you should not invest in this company.
 You should sell, and we dont really want to do that because we were just the bookrunners on the IPO.
 Its probably easier to just drop coverage.
 The logic of why theyre dropping guidance is like, look, all the companies that we thought were going to be customers are going out of business.
 We are a picks and shovels business for an industry that is going away.
 Yes.
 The gold rush is drying up.
 People are not going to want to buy Levis and at this point in time No one is moving to California.
 Its unclear yet that Levis are going to become a fashion statement, which of course they do, metaphorically speaking.
 David, youre like three levels deep here.
 Take me back to storytelling.
 Exactly.
 Okay.
 By its clear that theyre running into a brick wall.
 Ben manages to engineer a deal to offload the entire infrastructure business to EDS, Ross Perots Electronic Data Systems company.
 With that, we need to do a company profile on it at some point.
 Thats like a fascinating one Totally.
 They sell, basically, the entire business for .
 million.
 They lay off almost everybody at the company.
 Thats of what they last raised at.
 No, they went public for more than that, for more than million.
 I think it was actually about flat when they went public.
 So  on the dollar is what theyre liquidating the server business for.
 Totally, but they dont give up.
 They decide weve got this tool that weve built internally to help us provision the servers that were racking in our data centers.
 We might be able to sell that as software, its pretty good.
 EDS is actually really interested in this.
 They want to own the infrastructure business because thats part of their business.
 But theyre like, if you can deliver that as a software product, well presign up and will be at million a year customer for you for the server automation product.
 Which is million that Loudcloud is like great, we can use that to make payroll.
 Exactly.
 They do this.
 They laid off most of the company and they restarted as this software firm doing data center server automation.
 Theres only one problem.
 The tool that they built, which is so great, has no UI, it is called the Jive, and is entirely pimpthemed.
 Thats just one problem.
 Thats just one problem.
 Its not exactly something you can really deliver to EDS or any customer.
 When this happens, the stock to  which is a million market cap.
 Remember, theyve got .
 million in the bank and a solid million a year customer contract.
 Talk about trading below book value.
 The street is valuing them at half of the cash on the books.
 But Ben is undeterred and this is mostly what he writes about in The Hard Thing About Hard Things.
 They go to work and they rebuild the company back up.
 They clawed their way all the way backover really not that long a period of timeto five years later, they sold the company to HP for .
 a share or .
 billion.
 Close to X what they went public for.
 Totally.
 This is a win.
 Ben would write later about this, If Id learned anything it was that conventional wisdom had nothing to do with the truth and the efficient markets hypothesis was deceptive.
 How else could one explain Opsware, which is what they changed the name of the company to, trading at half of the cash we had in the bank when we had a million a year contract and of the smartest engineers in the world?
 No, markets werent efficient at finding the truth they were just very efficient at converging on a conclusionoften the wrong conclusion.
 This experience I think would totally inform really what I think was the founding thesis of Andreessen Horowitz, which was there is no bubble.
 The internet is going to keep getting bigger.
 You all think were crazy for paying these prices for these companies, but were not crazy.
 Yeah.
 What youre alluding to there, for folks that dont know, Andreessen Horowitzs early reputation is that these guys started a brand new venture firm.
 They raised too much money because then in a million fund was big, and theyre just giving startups these crazy valuations, overpaying, and blowing everybody else out of the water.
 David, youre exactly right.
 The efficient market hypothesis is wrong, and also that any crash were in is a local minima.
 All that matters is can you get through this localized crash and continue to ride the intrinsic value wave that is the internet and software taking over everything?
 Totally, and its not easy.
 Literally, the title of the book that Ben writes about this is The Hard Thing About Hard Things.
 Which is so good.
 So good.
 Its such a good title.
 Its like they had good marketing people there or something.
 To your point about it not being easy, Ben gets asked in interviews.
 How do you get through that when you had to lay off half the company and then get the other half to recommit to basically starting a new startup with you?
 His answer is, a lot of crying by me.
 Its brutal.
 But I think the lesson to be learned from this and it totally resonates for me is if youre in a technology market and you find yourself early to the market like they did with the cloud and virtualization.
 Beating AWS by seven years.
 Its not good to be in that situation.
 But if you could just hang on and stay alive until the market can catch up with you, these markets will grow.
 You can become a big, big player even if everybodys already written you off.
 Can you stay alive long enough to become lucky?
 Yup.
 Obviously, its better to be lucky upfront, but if youre not, wait for luck to come to you.
 Anyway, theres one more other fun little part of the Loudcloud Opsware journey.
 One of the characters thats going to become very important later in part two, which is one of their other board members.
 The board of Loudcloud, pretty awesome, Marc Andreessen, Andy Rachleff, Bill Campbell the coach, obviously Ben, and the other independent board members who they had, do you know who it is, Ben?
 No.
 Michael Ovitz.
 Thats how they met Michael Ovitz?
 Thats how they met Michael Ovitz.
 Of course, were talking about super Hollywood agent, founder of Creative Artists Agency, Michael Ovitz, later erstwhile CEO and President of Disney under Eisner.
 Briefly.
 After the whole Disney debacle, he was looking for stuff to keep him entertained and wanted to invest in the then hot internet area.
 He gets introduced to Ben and Marc and ends up joining the board of Loudcloud.
 Isnt that wild?
 Wow.
 Thats how Marc and Ben get infected with the idea of creating the CAA of venture.
 Totally.
 Its so funny how weve painted hopefully the picture on this episode of all the life experiences leading into Netscape, leading into Loudcloud, leading into that moment with Benchmark, and then Ovitz joining.
 It all gets expressed by Andreessen Horowitz.
 Theres one more principle that you touched on earlier that I want to tie a little bit of a bow on thats a founding principle of the company.
 When Ben Horowitz is getting dressed down in the partner meeting at Benchmark and they ask him when are you going to hire a professional CEO?
 This becomes a major tenet of Andreessen Horowitz about technical founders being CEOs, being armed with the resources that they need, and the ability toeven before they would otherwise acquire those skillshave a leap on being a professional CEO.
 Theres this interviewI love reading things from about Marc and Ben because its this really interesting perspective where its postNetscape, postLoudcloud, postcrash but theyre just angel investors.
 Its six years before they start Andreessen Horowitz.
 One of the questions in this great QA that well link to in the show notes is, should a founding technologist run a mature company?
 Marcs answerhes a brilliant person.
 He gives these long philosophical answers to every other question.
 This one he just answers absolutely.
 Its so great.
 This is so brilliant.
 Well talk about this much more in the next episode.
 But whats so smart about this and so dumb about the rest of the venture capital industry until Andreessen changed the game.
 Lets put aside whats right or wrong or what you believe or dont believe.
 It was so dumb to preach and practice anything else except that founders should run the companies they start because if you say anything else, who are you alienating?
 Youre alienating founders.
 If you want to win deals, why on earth would you say anything other than I support my founders and Im loyal to them to the end?
 Yeah, just wild.
 Well, before we continue on a little bit, I want to unveil our third sponsor of this season.
 We are joining the ranks of Casey Neistat and PewDiePie this season to tell you about NordVPN.
 But we are doing this in our own little way, Acquired listeners.
 This company has a wild story behind it that we are excited to tell you about.
 NordVPN, as you may know from other fine podcasts, is a product by Nord Security.
 It works on all major operating systems.
 Its become one of the worlds largest VPNs.
 They hold the title I think for the worlds fastest VPN.
 Theyre now a global company with over employees worldwideand are used by an astonishing million people.
 Yes, the internet is a big place now that there are million people using one VPN client.
 Its a big, big business.
 But here are some things you may not know and why theyre working with us this season on Acquired.
 The company is one of the rare big tech companies that were started in Lithuania.
 It was founded in by four childhood friends.
 The cofounder and CEO Tom Okman is a member of the Acquired community.
 He literally DMed David and I in Slack.
 Hes been listening to the show for years.
 Insanely, with Nord, they have grown to this whole crazy scale that I just talked about without taking of outside funding.
 This is impressively a bootstrapped company that has products used by million people and employees.
 Were super excited to be working with them.
 I love this culture, this ethos, this founding story.
 If youre looking for a VPN service, look no further.
 You can sign up at nordvpn.
comacquired by clicking the link in the show notes or go to Nord and use the coupon code Acquired at checkout.
 Our thanks to NordVPN.
 Its so cool.
 Pumped to be working with you guys.
 Yup.
 Okay, David, take us forward.
 They sell the Opsware business to HP.
 Whats going on after that?
 Weve alluded to Ning a couple of times.
 Along the way, Marc had started Ning.
 What year is this?
 What year is that Opsware sale?
 We did the episode with Michel Feaster.
 Yeah, which was so great.
 She was at HP and bought the company.
 Way back in early Acquired history.
 I want to say it was .
 I actually didnt ever down when Marc started Ning.
 It was when Opsware was sold to HP.
 Marc was going along with Ning and Ning was a way for any community to launch their own social network.
 I guess in a way like what we have with our Slack community.
 Its like white label Facebook.
 Yeah.
 Once again, ahead of its time.
 Marc, I think, was not super thrilled with how that was going.
 He ended up stepping back full time, right after the Opsware acquisition, brought in Jason Rosenthal from Opsware who had been a Netscape guy before that to come in and run Ning.
 Marc stepped back to just being a chairman.
 Remember, now were in .
 Were now in the heyday of web .
, which is so funny.
 At any other point in time, if we hadnt had the tech bubble, the crash, and everything everybody lived through here, the rest of the market would have been gaga over Facebook, LinkedIn, Zynga, Shutterfly, Flickr, and everything that was going on.
 It was so exciting in the Valley.
 But because everybody still had the hangover from web .
, valuations were minuscule for these companies.
 Well, in even in venture firms werent raising new funds.
 Everyones preciously holding on to the last fund they raise, parceling out each dollar to their own portfolios, trying to make sure theyre only investing if its the very next Yahoo, and using their bullets very carefully.
 When Facebook came along in its one of the only obvious ones thats growing like absolute crazy and kicks off that next generation of venture capitalists are going to be able to start raising big funds again and come out of the tech bubble screaming.
 But even that takes a long time.
 Ironically, its Marc and Ben, arguably people who got hammered hardest by the dotcom crash, who recognize like, this is the time to put capital to work and embrace everything thats going on.
 They start angel investing together.
 Right.
 This is the era of super angels if you think back to the Ron Conway and Dave McClure era.
 There was the famous Bin scandal.
 But Marc and Ben are these super angels that are individually investing tens of millions of dollars in startups.
 Its easy to forget now but they were the prototype super angels.
 Easy to forget now because now of course theyre a venture firm.
 Of course, Marc made million on the Opsware sale fromI think its about right because he owned about of Opsware at the sale to HP, Ben owned .
.
 Theyve got cash to invest and theyre dedicated to helping to build the next generation of startups.
 Yeah.
 And not only that, this is where the pieces start to come together.
 They also embrace as users web .
, and thats a big part of web .
?
 Its blogging.
 The Pmarca blog and Bens blog, this is where it all starts.
 It was so good.
 Marc obviously became a prolific tweeter tweeting times a day.
 Then he stopped, and well cover all that in the next episode, but very much embracing the idea that Im going to be allowed on the internet.
 I am going to share my thoughts with the world and very early to blogging.
 Yup.
 Through all this, they end up angel investing in companies like Twitter, of course, Zynga, Facebook.
 LinkedIn.
 Marc is still on the board of Facebook and still keeps up with Mark Zuckerberg.
 I hope so.
 The Facebook story is super interesting.
 When Andreessen Horowitz the firm launched, they launched with a big piece in CNN Money.
 Zuck is quoted in the piece.
 He says, I moved to Silicon Valley in and I was introduced to Marc Andreesen by Facebook backer Peter Thiel in .
 Marc became a sounding board about management and how to build a strong technology company.
 He has strong views on that, and they helped shape mine.
 Marc homes in on important things.
 Its very liberating.
 He has helped me not worry so much about the unimportant things.
 What is Zuck talking about here?
 Remember the Yahoo situation?
 Where Zuck turned down the billion offer.
 When Zuck goes and vomits in the bathroom turning down the billion Yahoo offer.
 Literally, everybody around the table is telling him to sell.
 Supposedly all the VCs, everybody involved with the company, all the rest of the management team are like, we got to take this offer.
 Because remember, web .
, Flickr sold to Yahoo for million or something like that.
 Something like that.
 The idea that there could be a billion outcome now postbubble is crazy.
 Apparently, the only one of the advisors who told Mark not to sell was Marc Andreessen.
 Andreessen has a quote about this.
 He says every single person involved in Facebook wanted Mark to take the Yahoo offer.
 The psychological pressure they put on this yearold was intense.
 Mark and I really bonded in that period because I told him dont sell, dont sell, dont sell.
 That is why Andreessen ended up joining the Facebook board in as well as the eBay board in .
 Yeah, thats a fascinating one.
 Thatll come up next time for sure.
 He stayed on the HP board by the way after the Loudcloud Opsware deal until .
 He was a longtime HP board member too.
 Yeah.
 Its pretty crazy.
 They built up this vehemently founderfriendly, dont sell, build big companies, were going to finance you Technical cofounders stay as CEOs forever.
 Yup.
 We love technical cofounders.
 We are willing, just the two of us, to finance different companies.
 Including digg.
com, AngelList, Foursquare, LinkedIna lot of very meaningful companies of that era, high hit rate.
 Theyre the most active venture capitalists in Silicon Valley at this point.
 This is when Sequoias writing the RIP Good Times memo, and theyre not even venture capitalists.
 This is the best.
 I think this is my favorite part of the whole episode.
 One day, Ben is still at HP.
 He becomes a VP of something at HP and its clear, this is going to be just like the AOL situation.
 Hes going to stay there for a year and then move on, do his next thing.
 He gets a call from Doug Leone at Sequoia.
 Interesting.
 This is such a classic Doug story, I love it.
 Doug says, I want to know how you did it.
 Bens like, did what?
 Doug says maybe not quite these words, but maybe actually these words knowing Doug.
 I want to know how you took a dog of a company and turned it into a billion outcome.
 Ive never seen this happen before and I want to learn how you did it.
 Its so great because a its so Doug, what a learning machine b its so great because its obvious what is happening here.
 Hes trying to get Ben to come to Sequoia.
 Hes totally trying to get Ben to come to Sequoia.
 Do you think they wanted to recruit him as a partner or as a person to come fund next?
 Im sure they would have been happy with either, but Im assuming probably as a partner.
 I bet they were trying to run the same playbook they did with Alfred, which is when Alfred joins Sequoia after Zappos.
 The original idea, Don Valentine says this in the Stanford GSB talk that we always recommend when he holds up Alfreds resume.
 He says, yeah, Alfreds here.
 Hes a partner at Sequoia for now.
 But hell start more companies and we cant wait for him to start companies and spin them out.
 Obviously, that doesnt happen with Alfred.
 But Im sure they just want Ben and presumably Marc as well to just come be part of the Sequoia.
 Man, we dont do dissection episodes anymore but in the spirit of what would have happened otherwise, do you think about if Ben had accepted an offer to go be a partner at Sequoia?
 If Benchmark hadnt made the cardinal mistake of causing the executive team to potentially lose faith in their CEO right there in the boardroom, how things couldve been different in the Valley?
 Well, the funny thing I was thinking about through all this is obviously as weve alluded to, Andreessen Horowitz is going to counterposition against Benchmark when they launch.
 Nobody ever counterpositions against Sequoia.
 I think its just because like how could you?
 Theyre so good.
 Yeah.
 It reminds me of the quote from The Wire, you come at the king, you best not miss.
 I dont really want to make a run at Sequoia.
 I wouldnt publicly counterposition against them.
 I was thinking the exact same thing.
 Ben takes this call.
 I dont know the exact timeline here, so Im both hypothesizing and dramatizing for effect.
 But with that said, he takes the call.
 He knows what Doug is up to.
 He hangs up with Doug and he shoots Marc an instant message.
 We ought to start a venture capital firm and Marc replies, I was thinking the same thing.
 Boom.
 That our friends is where were going to leave part one.
 That is a perfect, perfect spot.
 I feel like I now have a really robust understanding about the frame of mind therein going into starting Andreessen Horowitz the firm.
 The question is when theyre texting or whether theyre on IM, is this before the financial crisis?
 I am imagining this is sometime in .
 Yeah, which is fascinating because then between the time where they have the idea to do this and when they actually launched the firm, there is a global recession and bank financial crisis that they have to fundraise during.
 Its pretty wild.
 Totally.
 I think we did a lot of great playbook themes during the episode, are there any you want to highlight here?
 Yeah.
 There is actually one, and well get into this more next time but its pretty courageous.
 Did you choose that word carefully?
 I did not, I did not.
 It came to mind.
 Its pretty courageous what they do here.
 Okay, its not courageous in that they have a lot of money.
 They never need to work again, etcetera.
 To turn down Doug Leone, to say we have a lot of money but were going to deploy this money and put it at risk while all the rest of the world thinks everything is falling apart.
 I think its easy to look back now and be like you guys of Andreessen Horowitz has billion in capital under management and is this massive, enormous person firm with all these funds and like, yeah, you guys are money managers.
 That is not how it started by any stretch of the imagination.
 Yeah, thats such a good point.
 Well get into this next episode, but from everything that I can hear, thats still the way that Marc and Ben act today.
 That theyre by no means enjoying the billion under management lifestyle.
 I think theyre very much thinking about what is the next, not just generation, but what is the next epoch of Andreessen Horowitz the firm looks like.
 What are we beyond a venture capital firm?
 What will this institution be in the future?
 The way that you chose courage carefully, I chose the future carefully.
 Were going to talk about both of those in the next episode.
 I love it.
 Ive got a few just to bring it back.
 The timing, luck, and right place, right time are so strong here.
 I mean, especially in the N slipping one year part of the story, Netscape wouldnt have existed if N had shipped on time.
 As crucial as it is to be brilliant, you have to be brilliant in the right place at the right time and get lucky also.
 People always talk about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates being born at the right time and the right place to be able to start Apple and Microsoft.
 Kind of the same thing with Marc being around right for the start of the internet and being able to really jump on the emerging web and create a huge part of it.
 I also think a big playbook theme is knowing what good feels like because youve experienced it yourself.
 In launching Mosaic and getting a million users in the first year on a very nascent web, for Marcs whole rest of his career, thats the bar.
 If youve never experienced something like that viscerally where youve operated, founded, or worked at a high level at a company that was undergoing that, because you dont know what the benchmark is, you dont quite know what youre chasing.
 I think it meaningfully shaped all of his future experiences, Bens experiences, and Andreessen Horowitzs experience when they knew what true productmarket fit and crazy growth felt like from the very first experience.
 I got one I really want to add to that.
 I totally agree.
 Yes, everything you said.
 And what makes it really powerful is the contrast.
 They also know what total failure looks like.
 I think you see a lot.
 People think, like what you said, knowing the benchmark, knowing success, thats what you need.
 I think you need both because if you only know success, you dont know the difference between success and failure.
 You dont really know what made for success and what was skill and what was luck.
 But I think whats really unique here in this story is they have absolutely both the highest of the highs, lowest of the lows.
 I think that can really help one triangulate where you are at any given point in time and why.
 I totally agree.
 I think its a great point.
 Well, listeners, were going to hold on grading until the end of our next episode.
 Well have that conversation about actually the firm, Andreessen Horowitz, rather than trying to create something about Marc and Bens past.
 David, do you want to do some carveouts before we bring it home?
 Yeah.
 Lets do it.
 Ive got a fun one that is tangentially related to at least the N aspect of the episode.
 Ive just been on such a gaming and classic gaming kick lately.
 I dont know what it is.
 Maybe its like you hit your mids and then you just get nostalgic for the era when you were a kid.
 My carve out is my new favorite podcast besides Acquired of course, the Resonant Arc YouTube channel and podcast.
 These guys are so great.
 They call themselves a video game storybook club.
 They take old classic video games like RPGs from this era.
 They did Final Fantasy VIII.
 Theyre now doing Xenogears.
 They did the first Nier game, which is more modern in the interim.
 Then they do like a book club.
 They do playthroughs.
 Theyre like were going to play not a stream, but were going to play from the beginning of the game to X point.
 Well go play, you audience go play, and then were going to do a podcast.
 Were going to do a threehour podcast at each checkpoint where were going to dissect the story, the development, who was the dev team, how did this project come together, and what is the context behind all this?
 Thats a clever structure.
 Its really, really clever.
 I really like it.
 It ends up for all these games being hoursworth of podcast time, but its so cool.
 It is a really innovative format.
 You know youre talking to people who are willing to dedicate hours of podcasts time to a single podcast like a Berkshire Hathaway trilogy.
 Couldnt have found a better place to recommend it.
 A podcast after my known heart.
 I love it.
 I have a little bit more of a serious one.
 Its a nonfiction book called The Elephant in the Brain, and it is a psychology book that was originally going to be this persons academic paper.
 Then they decided Im just going to get together with my friend, actually write it as a book instead, reach a much broader audience, and publish it as a consumerfacing book.
 It is a really interesting book.
 One of the main thesis is that we humans are animals and so why do we try and go around pretending that were not and trying to do things that are socially acceptable when theres an elephant in the brain, that we are animals and we are subject to these very base desires that come from evolution.
 Its not saying act on those, but every chapter points out a different and very observable basic animalistic thing that exists in our brain.
 The thing that I took away from it was once you can be more mindful of the way in which your brain is not acting logically or appropriately as you should present in society as it says its acceptable to.
 Just being aware of the way that your brain is working and why it is working in that way so that you can then apply your higher functions on top of it is very interesting.
 I highly recommend it for anybody who is interested in psychology, capitalism, how to fundraise for nonprofits, how to lead, how to organizationbuildall of this stuff is tied in there.
 They basically take anything that seems like people are doing purely altruistically or purely for whatever reason.
 They find the animalistic desires that underpin that and then find the data to support why that is often happening.
 Especially if youre interested in going into politics, its a phenomenal read.
 I love it.
 I recommend that.
 All right.
 Well, listeners, thank you for joining us on part one of this journey.
 Thank you to our sponsors, pilot.
com, PitchBook, and NordVPN.
 If you want to join us and talk about all things Acquired, all things tech with a great community, really thoughtful, respectful, good highbrow discussion, join us at acquired.
fmslack.
 As always, if you want to be a deeper part of what we do on the show, you can become an LP at acquired.
fmlp.
 David, anything else you want to say?
 Im pumped for season nine.
 We are underway.
 I know, me too.
 I think this next episode is going to be really fun.
 Andreessen Horowitz has played such a seminal role in the development of the tech ecosystem of the last years that its a walk down my whole adult life and career to walk through from to today.
 Im excited to do it.
 Yeah.
 Should we start recording right now, just run it back?
 Lets play two.
 No, I need a break.
 Listeners, well see you next time.
 Well see you next time and until then Yung Spielburg, Mike Taylor, take us out.
  may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate andor amusing transcription errors Hello, Acquired LPs.
 Welcome to another installment of the LP Show.
 This is an episode where it was actually recorded for a different podcast, one of Davids LPs in Kindergarten Ventures, Thomas McGannon, has a great podcast called The Unlimited Partners Show that he started earlier this year.
 Thomas is a dear friend of both of ours and it was very fun for me to get to listen to this episode and not participate at all.
 But youre doing such a great job with the intro, Ben.
 Thank you.
 David, what did you talk about with Thomas?
 Thomas pinged me about doing this and asked if we could talk about our recent Vanta investment.
 We did a SPV with close friends of the show, Vanta, together and Thomas participated in that.
 I said sure.
 We spent a bunch of time talking about Vanta, but we also talked all about Kindergarten, about how Kindergarten intersects with Acquired, and this sort of new form of venture capital that Im experimenting with now.
 The nonprofessional venture capital is what Im calling it.
 Its this rare opportunity to get to hear a GP and an LP talk about an investment thesis together.
 Thats what I thought was the most interesting.
 You get to talk about all the very firsthand knowledge that you have from the company from talking with Christina from all the stuff weve done with Vanta.
 Then Thomas comes in as the appropriately skeptical investor and talks about how he did diligence and where there were open questions and how to rationalize price.
 It was great.
 Listeners, youre in for a treat.
 With that, our thanks to the Solana Foundation for sponsoring all of the limited partner episodes this season.
 Indeed.
 Solana, as probably all of you by now know, is a global state machine and the worlds most performant blockchain.
 That means that developers can build applications on Solana with super, super low transaction fees compared to pretty much every other Web infrastructure layer out there and all with low latency and without compromising composability.
 It is truly a technical marvel.
 Weve had CEO Anatoly Yakovenko on the show before to talk about his time as a systems engineer at Qualcomm and how CDMA Technology influenced Solana.
 Yeah, and one thing to point out is while we may be in a crypto winter right now, having a little bit of insight on what many members of the team at Solana have been up to, theyre not slowing the pace of building at all.
 I would say it is just as good a time as any, if you have a great idea for something to build on the Solana platform, to build it now.
 I think its a trope, but my God is it a really good time to put your head down and make something that actually creates value for end users and customers.
 I know they would be happy to chat.
 You can learn more at solana.
comdevelopers.
 We also have some very, very fun news.
 We are going to Solana Breakpoint.
 We are, live show.
 Its a live show at Solanas Developer Conference in Lisbon, in Portugal at the beginning of November.
 We are super excited.
 Itll be a great time.
 We hope to see many of you there.
 Indeed.
 Before we get into the interview, We have something to ask of you.
 We just launched Acquireds survey.
 Our audience has grown a lot since the last time we launched one of these so we would be eternally grateful to all of you if you would take the three minutes, I timed it when I went through, to participate.
 Its mostly check boxes.
 One lucky winner will get a second generation AirPods Pro, as usual, and other winners will get Acquired tshirts from our fancy new merch store.
 Dude, I just picked up the new AirPods Pro and they fit my ears for the first time.
 The extra small tips finally fit my ears.
 Ive been rocking the original AirPods for like five years because the Pros didnt fit.
 Thats awesome.
 So excited.
 Be like David, get some AirPods Pro for your tiny ears.
 Win them by participating in our survey at acquired.
fmsurvey or clicking the link in the show notes.
 With that, none of this is financial advice as always, and without further ado onto the interview.
 When you reached out at that moment, I was just doing angel investing.
 I had gone fulltime on Acquired and was running that.
 Fortunately, one of the great unexpected true blessings of my life was, which its always funny to say but I dont know how else to say it.
 Acquired, which I love doing and doing with one of my best friends in the whole world, kind of unintentionally became a real business.
 That had kind of just recently happened and I was just angel investing in stuff that mostly came from Acquired writ large.
 Either relationships through guests on the show or what have you, but also the community and the Slack community specifically.
 There are a number of companies I angel invested in that I just met the founders because they DMed me in Slack.
 Then you DMed me and that started this relationship, which was super cool because you were not the only input, certainly my partner in Kindergarten was a big input to it too, but youre a huge input in us deciding to raise a fund around this.
 You were our first major LP to commit to that first sort of experiment fund and then a large LP now in our second larger more real, I dont know how you define real, but longer term fund, lets call it that.
 Im just so appreciative to you for being part of the Kindergarten Acquired investing journey and now Vanta.
 Its been great.
 I didnt know that.
 I appreciate hearing the dribble that comes out of my mouth sometimes has a realworld decision tree impact.
 The decision to go in the direction of using podcasts as a tool for making investments and building partnerships, it just made all the sense in the world to me.
 When you go and you find the smartest, most creative, hardest working people speaking in real time and you can reach in, ask questions, and build relationships, it was a very obvious decision to me.
 Im glad that what was obvious to me has built itself into a real business and a real partnership.
 Youve spent a long time as a venture investor.
 When you stepped out into running Kindergarten, what were some of the experiences that you had that you wanted to replicate?
 What were some of the things that you thought that you could do better than what your prior iterations of venture investing?
 Basically, what did you see that might suck out there that you guys could help?
 Even though Kindergarten might be a small fundI guess all businesses start as small businesses and I think that its a reflection of the evolution of the capital formation.
 What were some of the thoughts that you had when you guys set it up?
 There are a number of threads we can pull on here.
 The first thing I would say is that with Kindergarten, we werent really thinking about doing things better than at least how I had done venture in the past and the traditional way of doing venture, but we were very intentionally thinking about doing things differently.
 My goal and I think we are very much a coexisting player in the ecosystem.
 Life is long and you can never predict what will happen.
 I would be very, very surprised if what were doing ends up disrupting traditional ventures in a major sense.
 I think its very much a coexisting, a complimentary aspect to capital formation and traditional ventures.
 My set of experiences at the firms Id worked at and then also observed close to, I do think one thing thats universal in an investing partnership is the partnership is super important.
 We talked about this a lot in partners in our last episode we did together, the first Unlimited Partners episode.
 That was like a very very kind of intentional focus of partnering with Nat, starting slow, having this be an informal thing, and see where it goes.
 Im glad we went that direction.
 The partnership has been going great so far.
 In terms of the different versus traditional venture, theres just a number of elements that kind of were all coming together right around that moment that I saw.
 One and certainly very critical was the kind of enabling technology, if you could call it that, the enabling platform of AngelList and AngelList funds.
 The first Kindergarten fund, as you know, ended up being .
 million total in the fund.
 Our intention that we set out was to raise million.
 We wanted to create a million fund, which just wouldve been completely impossible.
 Theres no way that wouldve worked in any way, shape, or form before the AngelList fund administrative platform which had really only matured enough.
 Its existed for a few years, but it was only like getting to a point where I felt comfortable as a former professional VC fund manager being like okay, there are some compromises that were going to make by doing this.
 Everything is a tradeoff, but its viable that we could run a fund on this platform, especially a small fund.
 That was certainly one like okay, this is possible.
 Then two, this dynamic existed for a while, but I was seeing it more and more in my angel investing and around Acquired that I felt like there was room in the venture ecosystem for, like you said, complimentary capital to the big traditional venture fund players.
 One of the hardest parts, probably the hardest part, reflecting on my career in traditional venture is at the end of the day, every round is a zerosum game.
 If youre a sizable fund, you really need to lead rounds.
 I did plenty of partnering, splitting rounds, and all that, and that can happen on the margins.
 Really truly, if you want to be a great fund manager and a great fund, you need to lead rounds in the best companies.
 The best companies tend to be very competitive.
 It ultimately boils down to answering a very simple question, which is why is an entrepreneur going to take your money over instead of Sequoias, Andreessen, Benchmarks, founders funds, or what have you?
 Frankly, most people dont have a good answer to that question.
 A lot of people have answers to the question, but theyre not good answers.
 For pretty much my whole career in venture, I dont think I had a good answer to that question.
 What angel investing and stepping outside of that dynamic opened my eyes to was theres this whole different world where its not instead of, its not a zerosum game, its not take my money instead of Andreessens money.
 Its take Andreessens money and take my money.
 That is really a core component of what were doing with Kindergarten.
 With a milliondollar fund, I mean, youre not doing this for the economics of the business.
 How do you think about the time that you put into Kindergarten, the relationships that it can build with companies and with other capital partners?
 I think that theres something really strategic in my mind about the way that you are building Kindergarten and Id love to hear you riff on some of that.
 That first fund, theres only so much in any dimension you can accomplish with a milliondollar fund.
 That was very much intended to be an experiment of lets just see if some of these hypotheses we have like is the AngelList platform viable?
 Can we do this while Nat and I both have very consuming fulltime jobs and not think of this as like our hobby on the side, but as an integrated part of all of that in our ecosystem, which I think is your question that well get into in a second?
 That experiment went well.
 Its now, as you know, our current fund is million plus with a few SPVs, including this Vanta investment.
 Were going to have significantly more capital under management.
 What I was seeing through angel investing and what Nat was seeing as kind of a leading founder in InsureTech in a specific space, was we had all of these opportunities to have relationships with other founders and other companies that were great companies that were raising great rounds from the best venture investors, and we had opportunities to invest capital, but also, just as important, have business and personal relationships with those companies.
 The easiest to illustrate on the Acquired side are guests we would have on the show and our sponsors on the show.
 We would have venture capitalists on the show and they would be doing rounds.
 They would want to invite us along.
 Say a GP at XYZ firm, Im bleeding around at this company.
 Of course, Im going to do or of the dollars into the round, but we leave some open for valueadded angels and other folks.
 You have this great platform with Acquired, with the podcast, and with the community.
 Wed love to have you as part of it.
 We were seeing literally the VCs invite us into deals.
 That was a very different experience than the zerosum game of before.
 But the companies too, our sponsors and our guests want to have deeper relationships with us.
 Theyd ping us and say hey, were raising around.
 Would you be interested in being a part of it?
 Wed love to have you.
 Sometimes we were getting folks who are founders saying youre seeing such a great deal flow.
 Let me know when youre doing deals.
 I angel invest as well.
 Id love to come in and be part of it too.
 We were kind of thinking man, Kindergarten could be a way to just tie all of this together and do it at a much bigger scale than we could do with our own personal balance sheets.
 When you and Nat are building the top of the funnel and sorting through whats going to make an interesting investment for Kindergarten, what does that process look like?
 What do you guys usually use as your way of communicating?
 How do you articulate a priority stack so that the other person really gets whats most important, whats kind of nice to have in an opportunity?
 I can tell you what we dont do, which is what traditional VC firms do and what I used to do.
 We dont have Monday meetings.
 We dont sit together.
 One of the firmsI wont out them I worked at in my career.
 I actually love this.
 This is great.
 They ran the whole firm on a whiteboard.
 They had a whiteboard in the conference room and the Monday meetings would happen in that conference room.
 There were doors on the whiteboard, so the rest of the week the doors would stay closed so other people didnt see it.
 Literally the whole firm, the portfolio company, the active portfolio companies, the pipeline of deals that the firm was prosecuting and ranked order, it was all just there on the whiteboard and got together.
 It was just funny that they did it on a whiteboard.
 Every firm does a version of this.
 You talk about the portfolio, what the needs are, and whos raising.
 You talk about all the deals that every partner is interested in and what are the highest priority and you align.
 That is not what we do, not what we do at all very intentionally.
 I dont want to claim yet.
 We dont have real performance on the board.
 Were still very early so I dont want to claim that this is going to work necessarily.
 When we meet and interact with companies, its not in the context of theyre raising a round, theyre coming to pitch us, and theyre presenting their deck and theyre trying to raise money.
 We get to know these companies and these founders in a very, very different context.
 To speak to my side, I get to know sponsors on Acquired and guests on Acquired.
 I see and I interact with them.
 I interview them on the podcast so I know them in that way.
 Then I get to see how the Acquired community, how does our listener base react to these companies for our sponsors.
 What are the clickthrough rates or I guess how many people ping me after the episode and say gosh, that was amazing.
 I would love to connect or I can help with XYZ.
 How many VCs ping me and say that was awesome.
 Can you introduce me to the founder?
 I want to lead the next round.
 I just kind of have a natural sense.
 For the sponsors too, I have a business relationship with these companies.
 I know how they are to work with.
 Its just pretty obvious to me which are the ones that we want to put money behind.
 I turned my camera off, but Im smiling really big right now because the data that you are pulling together through that process I think its so differentiated.
 I think in many ways youre getting to see what it looks like when people dont think theyre being watched.
 You get to see into a business' communication funnel in a way that I dont think is even possible in a traditional fundraising route.
 No because its performative.
 Precisely.
 Having the opportunity to build that authentic and what authentic means is its not performative.
 Its something that is spur of the moment.
 Its truly like what these people and what these companies are, and it being like hard data.
 If youre talking about how much everyone loves you and then through the process of working with founders, having them as customers, seeing the way that your community relates.
 If youre seeing that thats not true, then I think that you have a very special way of making the exhaust of your business with the podcast kind of manifest itself into what I think is really interesting capital formation circulatory system stuff.
 Lets take Vanta.
 Lets get into Vanta as an example.
 Its the foremost example in our portfolio.
 Its such a beautiful case study of this.
 When did you meet Vanta?
 When was that time zero?
 Ill take you through the whole thing.
 Ben and I knew of Vanta and knew Christina Cacioppo, the founder, for a long, long time.
 She had worked as an analyst at Union Square Ventures back in the day.
 This was right after I left New York.
 I think she joined USV and I joined Madrona.
 Never actually connected with her but she blogged, USV is so public, and of course, I heard about her.
 Then when she left USV and went to start something in NYC, we tracked her and shes still a prolific blogger, but we never actually met.
 Ben and I are both very familiar with her and her work.
 Then one day, Patrick OShaughnessy from Invest Like the Best, who all of us here are friends with, sent Ben and me an email and he said hey, I invested in Vanta and Christina.
 Shes pretty awesome.
 She wants to meet you guys and she loves Acquired.
 Maybe on Twitter, wed had some interactions.
 I knew that she was a fan.
 She loves Acquired and she wanted to talk to you guys about sponsoring.
 That was how we first directly connected with her.
 We love all of our sponsors, and many of them are like this, but she was just a dream to work with.
 We interacted directly with her and we met other people in the company too.
 She was so clear about what the Vanta business is, why its compelling for founders and companies to use Vanta, and why our audience of primarily founders is a great fit.
 She was just wonderful to do business with as was the company.
 It was very smooth and easy.
 That was the sponsorship process.
 Then shortly thereafter, the company was raising the round, she sent Ben and me an email.
 This was right as Kindergarten was getting going.
 She said hey, were raising this round.
 I love you guys.
 Id love to have you be part of it if youd be interested.
 No pressure.
 Obviously, at this stage, youd be small checks, no big deal.
 Kindergarten invested out of the fund in that round.
 I think that was what happened next.
 Then we just got to know her better through the sponsorship.
 She invited us to a Vanta allhands meeting.
 This wouldve been, if I remember my timelines In the spring of this year.
 I remember listening to it.
 I was in Singapore.
 It was like degrees, I was on a long jog, and I was listening.
 It was an allhands for you guys.
 It was right before you decided to start the podcast.
 It was, yeah.
 Just a couple of days actually.
 She invited Ben and me.
 Ben was in town.
 It was when we did the Altimeter episode with Brad.
 Thats right.
 We had told Christina that Ben was going to be in town.
 Wed love to get together.
 She was like actually, were doing allhands.
 Why dont you come by?
 Well do a little fireside chat.
 Ill interview you guys.
 We ended up releasing it as an LP episode, but she didnt ask for that.
 That wasnt the intention.
 We just thought it was so good.
 We were like, great, well bring the microphones and well record it if it ends up being good.
 We got to meet the whole team in person in the office, and just had a great time.
 We were so impressed with everybody.
 We got to meet Matt Spitz, the Head of Engineering.
 For our arena show that happened a couple months later in May, we invited Christina to come up and do the interview portion on stage.
 She couldnt make it because they were doing what we did in March, I guess it was the regular, weekly, or biweekly all hands at the office.
 They did their annual offsite down in Palm Springs.
 The whole company flew in from all over the world and obviously they were leading down there.
 Matt, who wed met at the all hands did a turn and burn.
 He flew up from the offsite in Palm Springs up to Seattle to come to the show and then flew out that night to go back to Palm Springs.
 Anyway, I say all this just to illustrate the depth of the relationship and how none of this in my career as a professional venture investor wouldve been any part of the equation.
 Then when Vanta was raising this addition to the Series B, the round that we invested out of the fund, Sequoia led the series A, Craft and David Sacks led the series B in the end of April, beginning of May of this year in .
 We talked with Christina on our sponsor slots this season.
 It was literally I think the best round that any company has raised in so far.
 It was a million series B and a .
 billion valuation.
 Christina pinged us late this summer and said hey, were going to do a second close of that round because a bunch of LPs and the VCs are interested in putting in more money.
 If you have any interest, would you all be open to putting in more money?
 I was like, probably not out of the fund because were small.
 Its not our strategy, but let me ping our LPs and see if we could have interest in putting an SPV together.
 Hence, Thomas, why dont you take the story from here.
 Ill be honest.
 When the update came across that you guys were doing an SPV here, I was going to let it go by.
 I was busy with other things.
 We would not be talking if you hadnt reached out and said hey, Thomas, I think that this suits you guys really well.
 I think you should take a look.
 I had definitely been familiar with Vanta through your relationship as them being a customer.
 Its the same with a lot of podcasts.
 And again, just referring to the network that gets built and the kind of liquidity that that facilitates amongst talent, customers, and capital was something that you did a really nice job helping me get focused on.
 It came at a really good time because a lot of the conversations that Ive been having with my clients, the families that I work with, theyre asking for cybersecurity investments.
 They see the breaches, they see the compounding nature of the problem and the value that is encapsulated in a secure digital estate and want to invest in that.
 Personally, Ive struggled a lot with cybersecurity investments.
 There arent that many high quality generational companies built here.
 A lot of times its because people try to build force fields, and building a force field, its just an ephemeral advantage that you could potentially build.
 The nature of the investment started to look really attractive because it was something that I knew I was being asked for.
 As I started to do my due diligence across my network, reaching out to general partners that have lots of insight into their customer subset, fastgrowing, a lot of YCbacked companies that are just getting to that point where theyre winning customers and this is table stakes.
 This is an expectation.
 Hearing some of those founders say, oh my gosh, Vanta is a verb.
 All of our portfolio is using it.
 It really started to wet my enthusiasm because I thought that you could build what initially today is a product company with SOC compliance, but eventually, I think it can evolve into a platform company.
 Were or minutes in yet and we havent even talked about what Vanta is as a company.
 Yes, we should probably do that.
 This is what got me so excited.
 Way back when I was at Madrona in Seattle, I had done some cybersecurity investing.
 Gosh, that was like or and I felt the same pain as an investor that youre describing, Thomas, which is clearly, this is a massive market.
 A huge need for any person, any company needs cyber security.
 Its so obvious, the need.
 Its perfectly ubiquitous.
 Everyone needs it.
 Yes, but the problem with the industry that I found in investing and I think has mostly still been true to this day is that its all fud.
 Its all like building force fields, as you say.
 Its teams coming out of the NSA or the IDF in Israel and these companies end up either looking like services companies or they build the latest and greatest force field that works until something else comes along thats better.
 Its just this very difficult space to build actual durable products and moats in, and then here along comes Vanta.
 Vanta is explicitly, and Christina will be the first person to tell you, that we are not a security company.
 Were not from the NSA.
 Were not building force fields here.
 They are a security monitoring company.
 I had this aha moment for me in getting to know them and the product, seeing the uptake in our community, the rapidity of clicks on the links in the show notes, the customer adoption, and theyre adding hundreds of customers every quarter.
 Its very much like a Datadogtype situation.
 Theyre not building the force fields, theyre monitoring the force fields and everybody needs that.
 The topic of observability was one that really dominated the last year that I spent as a public hedge fund manager.
 These are companies like Datadog, Splunk, New Relic, and AppDynamics.
 Having visibility into a digital estate, knowing that metadata that speaks about the software that youre working with, that speaks about the process that is being run.
 I think about the internet as this vast trove of data, and you need some kind of process of synthesizing and curating and thats why I think podcasts are so cool.
 In a similar way, monitoring observability, seeing how your software components, especially in an increasingly fragmented servicesbased is a very ephemeral way that we build and run software.
 The importance of having monitoring instruments throughout your organization and the fact that this is getting to a scale where human hand drawn, whiteboard, Excel, processes, screenshots, it just doesnt work.
 Its breaking at an accelerating rate.
 It really gets me excited.
 I mentioned earlier how I became so in love with software was hearing the Salesforce journey, the way that the CRM has been stood up as a pillar of data insight action, and believing that as software eats the world, youre going to have multiple other forms grow and evolve.
 Their point of view for how this problem gets solved and where to insert themselves, I found it really compelling.
 It has to be software at this point.
 I mean, by the time this episode comes out, our Acquired episode on AWS will be out, part two of the Amazon saga, part two of Im sure many to come over the years, but the story of AWS.
 At this point, AWS is just one cloud provider.
 Its just the infrastructure layer, the base layer for building, I say a technology product, but really anything.
 Everything runs on AWS these days.
 There are other cloud providers out there too and lots of businesses of any scale use multicloud.
 AWS has hundreds of different services and thats just the infrastructure layer.
 Understanding are all of those services, do you have them configured correctly?
 Are the right access protocols on there?
 Who has access to the data?
 Thats the infrastructure layer.
 Now layer on the vast diaspora of application and software middle layer products between your infrastructure and then your end product.
 Youve got hundreds to thousands, literally thousands of different software products that have access to data, that have security vulnerabilities that weave together to comprise the products and services of every industry in the world right now.
 Theres no way that a team of humans can keep track of that.
 No.
 I think that one of the pieces of this investment thesis, which is to say investing in compliance automation broadly, that I really like is, as I look at some of the notable breaches, I was listening to Okta earnings call yesterday.
 Theres a lot of conversation about some of the customer breaches that theyve had to deal with.
 Its not Okta software that were principally talking about.
 Were talking about software that is in their supply chain.
 When you come home from school and be like, mom, I was doing this, but the other kids were doing that, youre responsible for what those other kids are doing in your cloud software estate.
 What expectations can you put in place to ensure that the cloud services that youre bringing in are being run in a compliant, defensible, and also in an organization where they have a culture of compliance?
 I think one of the things I really enjoy doing with an investment thesis is talking to consultants, like the Capgeminis or Deloittes that have seen dozens of implementations of security programs and can talk about, as a people process technology, what works and what doesnt?
 The thing that I realized in doing these calls through Tegus was that Another great friend of Acquired and Unlimited Partners.
 Mike and Tom, theyre so cool and the acquisition of Canalyst, I really think that thats the generational financial service provider technology layer.
 Its going to be very, very cool what theyre building.
 But in any case, in talking to these experts that Tegus sets up, you really come to appreciate that the best that you can hope for when it comes to cybersecurity is to have a culture of compliance.
 That is something that gets not a snapshot in time once a year, its something that is continuous.
 Its something that is part of the DNA of the way that you build the ways that you communicate.
 By adopting something like Vanta, and there are other competitors, thats something that as an investor I take very seriously.
 But I think that this layer could eventually be a very large pillar in the digital estate.
 One thing Ive learned in the past several years, I catch myself whenever Im about to say something is inevitable or I cant imagine any future where this doesnt exist.
 Im like, oh, well, none of us know anything.
 Strange outlier events can come to pass, as we all know now.
 But I think it is very, very likely in the future that this is a very large category of software because its very hard for me to imagineagain, never say neverthat youre not going to use software to do this.
 Yes.
 I dont think theres any question about whether this is an automated instrumented solution.
 I think for me, at the foundational layer, when I make an investment, I like to think about it, like Geoffrey Moore has his stack of what a business is.
 At the low level, its the infrastructure.
 What are the first principal inputs that go into the world that your business is executing against?
 Here, the infrastructure layer is the software eating the world and the clouddominated software estate.
 What sits on top of that is a business model.
 What are the products that youre building to serve to your customer base?
 How does that draft on the wave of whats occurring at the infrastructure layer?
 And then on top of that, is the operating model.
 How are you going to market?
 How are you communicating, pricing, creating, and capturing value?
 At the low level, the infrastructure of what compliance automation executes against, I dont have any real concern there.
 Where I start to ask questions is, this opportunity will exist.
 This is a when not if.
 But is this going to be a compliance automation company that captures this kind of ingest and process communication layer, or is it going to be something else?
 Is it going to come from a monitoringtype solution like a Datadog?
 Is this tool something that can be built and appended into a ServiceNow, perhaps?
 Because right now, what Vanta is, its a tool, its a product.
 I think that theres a really exciting future where it does mature into a platform and then it has a lot of value that Id love tomaybe we can talk about grading this towards the end.
 But whether Vanta or one of its competitors owns this opportunity, they created the category, but they are not guaranteed to win it.
 I think that when you look at the depth of integration, the sophistication of the data, and the flows and the processes, that other businesses in orthogonal parts of the data journey have, there is a real question in my mind whether this is an opportunity thats captured by the players that are creating this category.
 People who are familiar with fans are probably wondering why we havent brought this up yet, the SOC and compliance.
 Probably, these days if you hear Vanta on an Acquired episode, an Invest Like the Best episode, out there in the world, or if you use Vanta, your company, which if you dont, you should, you are probably using it to get SOC compliant.
 Thats a really interesting aspect of how this market has developed and what the gotomarket that Vanta pioneered.
 There are the security compliance standards of which SOC is the broadest and most wellknown that most businesses are going to want to have.
 The waybefore Vanta and its competitors, but Vanta was the first to do thisa business got SOC compliant was you hired some auditors, either independent auditors, Deloitte, Accenture, or somebody to come if youre a bigger business, to come in and audit your security, infrastructure, protocols, and all your software supply chain.
 Then they would issue a compliance report and say, okay, you are now SOC compliant.
 The same thing for HIPAA and healthcare or GDPR in Europe for data practices.
 What Vanta said is we can actually use that as our gotomarket channel.
 We will be the software product that wont actually do.
 You still have an auditor that we partner with or you bring in, come in, and do the certification to get the compliance certificate.
 Rather than having a team from Deloitte come parachute into your company for a couple of weeks and rummage around, do all of the work via software and automate it, and then the compliance gets much, much easier, at least a burden of compliance for you as a company, especially ongoing in the future years when you renew.
 Thats been the gotomarket strategy.
 I think this is super cool because eventually, we want to and I think Vanta, the whole industry and its competitors, can evolve into that big vision we were talking about a minute ago of security monitoring, continuous security monitoring, the Datadog for security.
 But I dont think Datadog, ServiceNow, or whomever certainly over the past several years havent been willing to say like, oh, were going to go get into the compliance certification business.
 Were going to go do SOC audits.
 Its been this cool little insulating bubble that theyve been able to build the business up within.
 Now, will all of that change now as Vanta and its competitors have gotten clearly, this is a fairly big market.
 Theyve gotten quite big.
 Im sure those larger companies that you mentioned that weve been talking about are paying attention to the space.
 But it was a really elegant way to start the company.
 Yes.
 I think that initially when I started my research and I heard people say, these are investors that had invested earlier in the company and had been observing it for a while, they said, gosh, we really would like for this whole process to be automated.
 What Vanta does is theyll automate up to of your processes.
 But at the end of the day, SOC compliance is an AICPA certification.
 These are auditors that are crafting the rules.
 I spoke with somebody that does security audits.
 He talked about how people are looking for the answer.
 An auditor will always tell you that theres no way that you can bring me the answer when I first sit down.
 The answer is found through the process of examining what kind of a business that you have and how youre approaching your compliance frameworks.
 As I look out at potential competition from other incumbents, I do think that the fact that this isnt completely automated, the fact that this is an auditor and chief risk officer focused sale and not as much like the developer bottoms up prototype this and run with it.
 She made a very smart decision that none of the other early competitors to Vanta did, which was that she in the early days of Vanta as a company, they partnered with the auditors.
 The Vanta value prop is not were going to take all of these human auditors and were going to turn all this into software.
 The early competitors, this is what they were saying.
 All these audit firms are gone like youre going to click buttons and then youre going to get your audit.
 What Vanta said is were going to turn into software the plumbing, the monitoring, the work, and the tools, and then well partner with auditors and audit firms.
 They will do the audit because as you said, the audit is a human opinion.
 That was the way the industry worked.
 What that did was two things.
 It didnt piss off the auditors because it would threaten their business the way that other early competitors were a threat to their business.
 But also, like you said, its actually not the right way to do things with the audits themselves to make that totally software.
 The auditors had a very good point on that.
 The other thing it did though, its funny youre talking about the gotomarket, it enabled, especially for SOC all of these younger companies, startups or younger and smaller companies.
 Using Vanta enabled them to go get SOC audits in a way that they couldnt before.
 If youre going to start, youre going to bring in Deloitte or even an individual solo practitioner.
 Youre going to bring them into your company for weeks and weeks and have them audit your security practices.
 No, of course, youre not going to do that for cost reasons, if nothing else.
 But with Vanta, you can say like, oh, no, all the actual work, the tool, we just do that with software now.
 We can just buy Vanta, then have an auditor come in, and we can be a seed stage Series A stage startup.
 How do you think that Vanta will perform in the current environment and the weather conditions that were all managing through?
 Yes.
 So far, its been good.
 Theyve been hitting a plan through which is great, or even slightly exceeding, which is great.
 Once you start getting compliance certifications, especially SOC youre not going to stop.
 Its very hard for me to imagine.
 Unless a business pivots significantly where youre like, well, I have been getting SOC compliance.
 I dont think Im going to do that in the future.
 If you work with any customers or partners of any scale, especially in anything financial services related, which is pretty much every product and service in some way, shape, or form these days, youre going to need this.
 Certainly, youre not going to take it away.
 Your partners and customers would be very unhappy about that.
 The risk to your revenue is huge if you were to take it away.
 I think its a very sticky product.
 I think the risk in this weather climate, as you say, to Vanta is if a bunch of their customers go out of business or pivot to something else, which Im sure will happen.
 Unless things completely stabilize or turn back up in the coming months, which could happen.
 But if that doesnt happen, if we continue into sort of a protracted, challenging weather conditions for the economy and for startups, for sure, that will start to happen, I think.
 How do you think about it?
 This was a big piece of how I thought about making the investment.
 I think that by working with companies who need SOC compliance as a way to earn their revenue, like this is a revenueenabling product or service for their customers to purchase, I like that a lot.
 As Ive been listening to public earnings calls, theres a lot of focus on rationalizing the existing footprint.
 If youre a usagebased model, something like a Datadog, a Snowflake.
 MongoDB, talked about how in their cloud native or digital native customer group, they were seeing some slowdown, just the rationalization of that footprint.
 But the binary nature of, do you have SOC compliance, do you not, and is it a critical piece to whether you can generate revenue, I really love that missioncritical nature.
 I think one thing that Vanta does really well that I would love to see them continue to perfect is finding ways of standing up SOC compliance certification as an announceable event for their customers, like celebrating that and also affixing the name Vanta to that achievement.
 Making Vanta a verb that states we take this seriously, this is part of our compliance culture, I think that that is a way that they can help drive customer success, but also deepen the commitment at that organization to Vanta.
 One of the individuals that I spoke with through Tegus used to work for one of their competitors.
 Hes now the director of compliance for a publicly traded learning company.
 I think whats important to remember here is this is somebody who has built a career building the processes, practices, and manuals for how this works.
 Whats easy and achievable to this individual might be very, very difficult for others that havent been so focused.
 His opinion was, what Vanta is right now is a system of record.
 You go to Vanta to see that your compliance processes are functioning the way that they ought to, but that is something that, with the right kind of skill and focus, can be taken inhouse.
 Once you have a successful SOC compliance program put into place, its not rocket science to internalize some of the products that Vanta builds.
 Where it becomes impossible to pull out is if it can graduate to a system of engagement where through automation, through dashboarding, and really robust integrations, the organization throughout has Vanta on their screens where it becomes something that as a methodology of maybe not daily, but weekly, monthly use that people are spending more time in Vanta.
 Which is just going to be a very necessary piece for them to build on to graduate to platform.
 But I think that for me, the real determinant of success for Vanta and for the investment is going to be whether they can make that transition.
 I agree .
 I suspect Christina and the company would also agree with that.
 I think thats true of probably any software platform.
 If you want to become a platform, you need to, like you said, go from a system of record is great, but you need to go to a system of engagement.
 Thats what Salesforce is, right?
 Right, exactly.
 Most businesses, its really hard to build a platform out of the gate.
 If you say platform and V of your businesses, you probably are not going to find success.
 You do have to go through this process of nailing a specific use case, really understanding your customer base and what their key missioncritical pain points are.
 I think that in terms of discovery and identifying what kind of a business that youre building, that is such a key low level piece thats so necessary.
 Then as youre spinning this up, being aware of whats my next act, my second, third, fourth act going to be here?
 I loved you, Andrew, and Howard Marks talked about as the innovation cycles shorten, the durability of existing competitive advantage narrows significantly.
 Historically, having a system of record business would have entered you to a decade of owning a specific use case, things are just moving too quickly.
 Yeah, not anymore.
 Thats why I say I think Christina and the company would agree with you.
 The product focus now is on building out Vanta trust reports, which is exactly that.
 Datadog for security was a good shortcut analogy, but what does it look like to have a system of engagement for this space?
 It looks like both internally at the company for monitoring, but also externally, for your partners, for your customers.
 Heres the Vanta power dashboard, a trust report from Vanta that shows you in real time, what are the security practices, whats the data access, red, green, and yellow.
 Whats the state of all of my services internally?
 Whats the state of my software supply chain?
 And to sharing that and being open.
 You mentioned earlier that youve had Christina on to talk about the fundraising process.
 People have talked a good deal about her skill as a leader.
 What for you makes Christina somebody that earns this like, ah, shes a special designation?
 I dont think you can ever underrate someone who you want to be around, do business with.
 Every time I interact with Christina, I come away, this is a classic thing that VCs say.
 I think they say it as this shortcut because you cant really put your finger on what are the components of it, but shes the classic founder.
 If I were ever to go work for somebody, shes one of the few people.
 I would be very happy to work for Christina.
 I think that that is certainly one element of it.
 I think the other element is Im very impressed with her as a founder.
 She went and pioneered this space.
 Vanta was the first company.
 She was the first person to see this in a very, very nonobvious way.
 She was on a very traditional Silicon Valley path.
 She went to Stanford and then she went to work at Union Square Ventures, which is in New York, not Silicon Valley, but a very Silicon Valley firm, even though its in New York, this hallowed position.
 Then she went to work for Dropbox.
 She left USV to tinker with some products, then went to work for Dropbox in Dropboxs heyday.
 Then she goes and starts this security compliance monitoring company with no security background and doing SOC audits.
 I remember at the time, to the extent that I saw what she was doing and focused on it, I felt this way a little bit, but I didnt even focus on it.
 Im sure most people were like, Christina, what the hell are you doing?
 You should go be working at Uber, Airbnb, or something, or starting some God knows what.
 It is just so not obvious that this space was going to be big, that there was defensible value to be built here.
 She did Y Combinator.
 The company di Y Combinator and they raised a little bit of money.
 I believe Pear led the seed out of Y Combinator.
 Great, great folks.
 I love the people at Pear.
 Ive known Mar for a long time.
 We were on a board together back when I was at Madrona.
 Anyway, and then they just went and operated for years, and everybody forgot about them.
 In the meantime, they were just executing.
 During the phase when so many companies were raising so much money without having product market fit or anything, she stayed so lean.
 Didnt raise any more money after YC got to over million.
 I believe she got to million in ARR for the company before she raised another dollar, which was that first big round from Sequoia last year.
 When that happened it was like, holy crap.
 To the extent that we were wrong about Christina and wrong about Vanta, like boy, were we wrong.
 I just love that.
 Its not often you see the combination of somebody who is genuinely great, I would love to work for you.
 And you can be so contrarian and be willing to do all the correct but nonobvious things that great founders need to do.
 Right now, theres a lot of conversation about durable growth and what constitutes durable growth.
 I think that as I try and ask myself, what are the companies with the people and the products that are best suited to really understand, internalize, and practice the inputs that go into achieving durable growth?
 For me, its hard to do that without having been built on a notion of scarcity, so my favorite companies.
 Like Tony Xu at DoorDash, the notion of improvements, or CloudFlare thinking about the scalability and that they would need to achieve for their business to kind of achieve its full vision, and what that required from a network speed and security perspective.
 Vanta having been a functionally bootstrapped business from zero to million in ARR, I think for me, that is a really critical component to answer for myself as an investor.
 Theyre raising now a growth round.
 Theyre going to be receiving north of million of capital, thats many multiples.
 How much did they raise in their Series A?
 Was it ?
 Yeah.
 Within a year and a half, theyll raise million.
 Exactly.
 Thats the point, that theyre going from very cash constrained to upwards of million of total capital coming into the business.
 Knowing that they have the ground level of appreciation for the value of a dollar, and I think in the most recent interview that you did with Christina talking about this round, just how theyre taking really a scientific approach to building their sales reps and the efficiency.
 Weekly cash reports.
 Precisely.
 I dont know too many companies in that were raising the kind of money, which was a lot of companies, that were doing weekly cash reports.
 You win races in the turns, not in the straightaways.
 was a straightaway.
 No one was winning a race last year.
 But this year, when things get more challenging and when communicating that value to your customers really has such a higher bar.
 You just hear everywhere the discussion about elongating sales cycles, which is really people spending a lot more time asking themselves, is this product or service really worth it?
 I think that in order to communicate that to your customers, I think that its something that you have to practice inside your organization.
 It does give me a lot of confidence that pouring in this amount of growth capital and that being a couple of times the inflow of investment arsenal that competitors are raising, I think that that does really portend getting ahead in this turn in the market.
 Were both now very biased to love Vanta and want to talk it up and everything.
 Thats great as we should be.
 But to be grounded in data for a little bit, opinions are opinions.
 I love it.
 Sequoia used to have this great saying about, theyre so good at changing their minds about things when the data is there.
 They meet companies early and theyre like, I dont know, is this durable, can this be a big thing or whatever?
 I think this is a Leone line.
 At a certain point in time, the data doesnt lie.
 If the revenue keeps coming in and keeps growing, you got to go with this.
 In Q of thats the current weather climate and arguably even worse than here in Q .
 Vantas customer growth accelerated.
 They added over customers in Q .
 What more can you say?
 The metric that I cared the most about here isI think the first question I asked youwhats Q going to do and how does that compare with the Q to Q sequential growth?
 Youre absolutely right.
 This is data thats coming in realtime and seeing how that rubber is meeting the road, the numbers dont lie.
 I dont know what the future is going to hold from a market perspective, from a product perspective, or from a customer expectation perspective.
 But having a team that is datadriven and has, again, that principle of scarcity woven into its culture I think is really important.
 Youre right.
 This has been a conversation about why it is that were enthusiastic to invest in Vanta.
 Ive listened to interviews that some of the founders of competing businesses have given some of the reasons for being their background, the credibility they have as founders.
 It is not a foregone conclusion at all that Vanta runs away with this segment.
 There are other businesses that are growing very quickly.
 I think that just because you create a category, it does not mean that you own it.
 Its going to be really fascinating to watch.
 Were there any dynamics with this round, the participation?
 Maybe the way that Id asked it is when you come in and you look at a business and the round that theyre raising, what are some of the questions that you ask?
 Whats being accomplished here?
 What are we bringing to the company that we didnt have before?
 What might be worth talking about that here?
 Coming back to the beginning of our conversation here about Kindergarten.
 If its interesting later, we can talk about Nat.
 You should have Nat on the show to talk about how he operates within it.
 For me and through Acquired, its really like I said, intentionally from the very beginning, both for personal reasons, just personal preference reasons and that I thought there was an opportunity.
 I dont want Kindergarten to look like, be, or feel like operate like a traditional VC.
 Ive done that.
 Thats silly, it gets great.
 You can make a lot of money.
 They serve a great role in the ecosystem, and the great ones are truly, truly great.
 But this line of thinking, and not that I think this is where youre going with this specifically, but the deal dynamics.
 I genuinely dont care about deal dynamics anymore.
 Its one of the things I hated about being a traditional VC.
 Especially, while I loved the firms I worked with and theyre a great partner, we were always fighting Sequoia.
 I said that question with Sequoia or Andreesen.
 You always had that question, this nagging always there was like, why is a great founder going to take my money, our money over name your top tier firm?
 And then the question that you ask yourself is, okay, if Im competing with them, why would the founder take my money?
 But the other really even more insidious question, truly more insidious that you end up asking all the time is, are they taking my money because the great VC is past?
 I just hated all that I think about the Groucho Marx line every day of I dont want to be a member of any club that would have me.
 I think that investing with you, working with your network, and kind of the supportive nature that a lot of what you bring to bear represents, it helps me answer that question in a way that I dont get to very often.
 Which is to say, I am joining the club that wouldnt have me.
 Im just going on the shoulders of someone else.
 I think that thats why I thought that partnering with you as I built out this practice of working with family offices would be a really high value, like a node in our network to build out, and it definitely has.
 Because that dynamic is so baked into the traditional venture ecosystem.
 Its kind of like the fish asking, whats water?
 Oh, yeah, the David Foster Wallace.
 I always love a David Foster Wallace reference.
 Totally, right?
 Me yanking myself out of that, its really Anyway, the way I think about all this, I truly dont care.
 For better or worse, I do not care about deal dynamics.
 When I want to invest in companies, its because I met them through Acquired, theyre great partners, I like what theyre doing, all those other reasons we talked about at the top of the show.
 Here in this Vanta situation, the deal dynamics are Craft and David Sacks.
 One of the greatest SaaS investors of all time led this round in the depths of the Q crash of .
 They didnt say the name Vanta, but they talked about this deal several times on AllIn episodes at the time.
 Sacks reference did a bunch.
 I dont know why he didnt say the name.
 Anytime that somebody talks about their book, its just an open flank for one of the Actually, you know what, youre right.
 I feel like especially on AllIn, I love those guys, one of the things thats so great about that podcast is the dynamics and the tension between all of them.
 But youre right, they dont talk about their book there because they pillar each other when they do.
 I love that they do the podcast, but that to me kind of highlights what I dont think is present in most partnerships.
 Whoever it is that were doing business with, any interview that I do, any investment, any introduction that I take, I genuinely want the very best for every person that Im coming across.
 I want to find ways of, oh, youve got a sundae, lets put some whipped cream and cherries on top of that.
 When you have e a weekly commitment to something that is fundamentally imbued with friction and competition at a layer that I dont think is a positive sum creating, its just like, I love the instruction and the conversation that comes through it, but Im going to build my business and frankly, my life a little bit different.
 Obviously, it works for the besties on AllIn like, oh, my gosh.
 The show has been successful, each of their firms have been successful.
 Anyway, all that aside.
 Sacks led the deal.
 The way all this kind of came about, it was always written to the docks.
 They were thinking about it, theres LP interest, but then as the summer went on and I dont want to quote her, but I had a bunch of conversations with her about this.
 She just decided, like you said, there are competitors out there in this space, this great round is happening, and I think just kind of came to the conclusion.
 She was like, you know what, lets get as much capital in as possible right now.
 Lets just fill up the war chest, not in a way of, oh, a hot company may or may not even have product market fit yet.
 Lets just do to raise money to raise money.
 But no, hey, this is a new climate.
 Theres competition out there growing fast, this is a great valuation and great round, it got great folks around the table.
 Nows the time to actually fill up the war chest with as much money as possible to go out and work like hell, execute, and be the winner, be the system of engagement of record in the space.
 Thats kind of how this all came together.
 When you see Craft lead a deal, I dont know if youve done business with them or participated in a lower level.
 Weve done a few early days deals with them.
 Yeah.
 Can you characterize what involvement the Craft has?
 What does a Craft investment look like?
 Ive never worked with them before.
 I could speculate.
 It would be pure speculation, especially with Kindergarten.
 Its not like I sit on boards with these companies.
 Another nonobvious thing that when I yanked myself out of the professionalI use professionals just to the term for the traditional way, but traditional is betterventure ecosystem of board seats.
 I had a conversation with a really great older generation investor who is just a wonderful, great investor, wellknown, all the things during that period.
 He said to me, board seats are one of the paradoxical, anti secrets of these.
 Theres all this ego and status wrapped up in whos on your board?
 I want to join the board of this company or lead this round, blah, blah, blah.
 And its like, theres no upside to being on the board in every dimension.
 Theres no upside for you as personally being on the board.
 Youre exposing yourself to a lot of risks, but theres no upside with the founder relationship either.
 You create this quasi, not adversarial, but it complicates the relationship.
 Hes like, I found in my career, I have much more influence on the company, I can be much more involved, happier, all the dynamics not being on boards.
 I was like, ah, yes, youre right.
 Why did I ever want to be on all these boards?
 Because of credentialing.
 Yeah, credentialing, exactly.
 Which is a totally normal thing to want, but I completely agree with you.
 If I were to sit down and say, hey, David, lets have a really nice conversation.
 Well share a lot about each other and our hopes and fears.
 Oh, by the way, I have a loaded gun that I just set on the table here that I not only have the opportunity to potentially use, but in many ways, have the responsibility, which is to say being a board member means that you are responsible.
 You have a duty to ensure that a business is performing to what you think is the highest and best use.
 Thats a really difficult responsibility set to execute.
 It really changes the dynamic of the relationship.
 It absolutely does.
 I think that thats something that I am learning and really appreciating the difference betweenIm on the board of one company.
 I have a great relationship with that founder.
 I think it helps that maybe also by investing at the seed stage when youre working with these companies, joining the board might be a little bit different because you know that their wellbeing supporting the founder is the job to be done by the board.
 But once you get to or million of revenue, that relationship gets a lot more complex.
 Or heaven forbid, a public company.
 Absolutely.
 Of course, I had great board relationships with many of the founders that I was on their boards.
 But the point that this investor was making to me that just totally hit home, youre right.
 There is a time in your career or a time in a company, there are situations where it makes sense.
 That investor, he takes board seats.
 Its not like he doesnt.
 In general, if the situation doesnt require it, its generally better not to be.
 Anyway, your question was about Craft.
 All of this is from afar, arms length.
 But I think what they are certainly what they market themselves in, but theyre quick, theyre just really plugged in on what the attributes of great SaaS companies are, particularly around investing, valuations, multiples, and all that.
 Theyre very datadriven on that stuff.
 Ive never actually studied all of the data.
 Itd be interesting to do so.
 But the common belief that I generally think is true in BB and SaaS products, that works pretty well.
 The consumer is different, more hitdriven, and more unexpected things can happen.
 But yeah, I think Craft is just really good at that, as our other folks like Emergence too.
 I love Emergence.
 Were super close with them too on Acquired.
 Theyre a little more qualitative.
 Theyre a little more liberal arts to Crafts engineering approach to SaaS investing, and thats okay.
 That works great for them too, but thats what I think of when I think of Craft.
 Its really helpful in my situation where Im bringing investments.
 I am not a professional investor in the way that Craft is.
 Im not a professional investor in the way that a real estate manager or a private equity fund is.
 I have to operate by way of proxy.
 In this environment where Im getting asked for cybersecurity investments, I have some beliefs on what good businesses might look like here, and what lower quality businesses have historically been.
 And then when I think about the people running the business and the investors getting on the cap table, I really have to lean on years of experience.
 Past performance doesnt indicate future returns.
 Thats total bullshit.
 Winners keep winning.
 At least in venture.
 In venture, past performance is definitely a predictor of the future returns.
 I think its increasingly a predictor of future returns, just as the benefits of scale become more and more pronounced.
 I really do believe that businesses in an internet age, particularly, skew to perfect commodities or perfect monopolies.
 I think that thats a very longterm fullness of time observation.
 But nonetheless, for us to be able to coinvest with some of the longesttenured, most rigorous BB focused SaaS investors.
 Its a really great opportunity that youve given me to come in and step in and make this investment because its really the product that I had hoped that I would be able to deliver when I started this journey when I reached out to you and said, hey, Ive got this thesis on podcast networks as a way of building an investment program.
 Maybe its worth spending a little time on that.
 The deal dynamics of the Kindergartens SPV here, maybe without getting into specific numbers, but for me and Nat, it gets going back to sort everything Ive been saying all along here a little bit on our first episode and the LP episode that Nat and I did with Ben where we talked about things about Kindergarten a little bit.
 Mostly about Kettle, but a little bit about Kindergarten.
 Hopefully, its clear that its genuine.
 Im not saying this as a faint.
 Were genuinely not trying to build a traditional venture firm, genuinely, genuinely.
 I want to do Acquired, Nat wants to do Kettle.
 Those are the things.
 Kindergarten is the part of that ecosystem flywheel, whatever you want to call it.
 Were not interested in scaling assets, under management to scale assets, under management and scaling management fees to scale management fees, and building a team in charging premium carry, which is what I was going to get into here.
 Hopefully, we can provide a great investment product to LPs like you.
 What clicked for me in this process, Id sort of maybe intuited this ultimately than chatting with you and hearing it.
 I think it was valuable to you, we dont want to raise large core funds.
 The Kindergarten fund two now is just about million.
 We might take it a little bigger, but thats the scale that makes sense, I think.
 This SPV vehicle will end up doing it.
 I think when all is said and done here, were just wrapping up some loose ends, itll be roughly about the same size as the whole fund.
 Doubledigit millions are close to it that were investing in Vanta here.
 I dont need to charge a management fee on that.
 We dont need to charge carry on that.
 We dont even need to charge carry on that for our large LPs.
 I hope to you that thats compelling and different.
 Its compelling at a lot of different layers.
 I think about your business and your motivations when we are partnering with you.
 When I see that Kindergarten is, its really play for you what is work for others, which is another way of you saying your margin, your fee structure is my opportunity.
 Youve mentioned a couple of times that youre not a professional investor in the traditional sense.
 Thats core to my thesis, which is the service that you are providing here connecting me as an LP to Vanta as a company that I get to invest in, as I put myself in your seat and I see how youre interacting with Vanta, the way that you are growing the surface area in Acquired for them to really get the full benefit of a partnership with you guys.
 When we start to talk about, okay, they opened their round, which this is maybe another thing I should have mentioned earlier.
 As Ive been asking people, hey, what do you think of Vanta, we have an opportunity to invest.
 People have said, oh my gosh, thats a really tight, highly sought after.
 How did you get into Vanta?
 And then I say, oh, its through David Rosenthal, and then everyones like, oh, yeah, thats right.
 Everybody loves David.
 I think, yes, that is the business that I want to invest in.
 I understand why it is that Christina opens the door for you to lead an SPV.
 When you and I are talking about what I need to do my job well, which is bringing thoughtful investments that fit specific needs that meet criteria, whereby I can point and say, heres where were adding value.
 For you to be so flexible on fees the way that you have, it really helps me feel like Im doing my job as an institutional investor.
 I think that, really, a lot of the lessons that I feel like I learned now on the allocator side of the table came from our mutual friends over at MITIMCo, especially Nate Chesley and Nav Harikumar, they focus a lot on fees because over the fullness of time, fees really do matter.
 Yeah, both management fee and carry.
 They both matter.
 We carry more than, but over a number of years, if youre charging management fee for years, thats of the fund.
 Yes.
 For me then to be able to go and articulate this investment to others, were not paying a management fee.
 Were paying probably half of the carry.
 I dont know what conservative is, but hopefully, we can do better than a gross return here.
 Lets just, for maths sake, say gross return.
 If Im invested in a and fund structure, then my take home is going to be about .
 In the way that you and I and Nat have set this up, our take home here is going to be .
 Four hundred basis points of differential performance in the context of coinvesting with a fund like Craft, Sequoia, and YC.
 Maybe to hopefully tie it all together a little more, this is why Im so excited about the opportunity that we hazily saw for Kindergarten and coming together, but also why I was so passionate.
 Once Acquired became a real business, I was like, oh, wow, I love doing this, its just amazing.
 This can be my livelihood, and I dont need to play the same game anymore.
 When youre in the traditional venture firm world structure, certainly I wont deny, theres an element of greed that goes into the high management fees, carry, building assets under management, and all that.
 Undeniably, there is greed associated with that writ large.
 Im not saying any individual people in VC are greedy, but its just in aggregate, incentives drive behavior.
 Theres another reason why all this happens, which is when youre trying to build a firm to compete in the zerosum game of being one of the best firms to lead the rounds, have the opportunity to lead rounds in the best founders and best companies out there, which is a zerosum game and you have to beat the other people, theres all this artifice building that goes into it.
 Of which your terms with your LPs are actually part of it.
 Being able to say to yourself, to your LPs, to founders, to others having it known in the ecosystem of, we charge premium carry because were that good, of which all the top firms do.
 Those are the elements of the firm building there too.
 The management fees are part of that, the full offices, the big staff, and all that.
 Again, theres nothing wrong with that.
 Thats the way the traditional ecosystem works.
 I think thats fine driving.
 I dont think were going to disrupt it.
 Were going to be complimentary for sure.
 Having done all that, I just didnt want to do it anymore.
 I was like, no, I do not want that in my life anymore.
 Its just so cool to be able to do this in a different way.
 Yeah.
 The other thing I wanted to mention here is, this is the first time that Ive invested in my career, which Id say over the last year.
 This is the first time where Ive had liquidation preferences as a feature for investments.
 When you have a software business that can grow very efficiently to several million dollars of recurring revenue, when youre investing as this round is put together in the preferred equity, you have a liquidation preference so that as long as the company sells for north of the money raised, you get a full return of capital.
 The total dollars raised?
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 I was a public hedge fund manager for years.
 Every stock that I ever bought absolutely had the potential that it would go down the very next day.
 Right.
 Imagine if you had that feature in the public markets where you could invest in XYZ security and be like, Im only playing for the upside.
 Ninetynine percent probability, my basis is not going to go below in this investment.
 Its very liberating for me as an investor that can go out.
 I think a lot about my job as being something of a bartender or a butcher.
 My job is to deliver the best product for the right solution.
 Im helping other people achieve their goals, so I need to be considerate of what their risk tolerances are, what their sophistication might be, and having the liquidation preference in this spot where I can help.
 A lot of the families I work with are more legacy in nature.
 This will end up being some of the first software technology exposure that they have.
 I care very much that this is a good experience and having the ability to say, all right, this company is being priced at times revenue.
 I think that we can earn a nice return on that.
 But in the event that the forecast doesnt pan out the way that were hoping, the downside is really, really limited.
 Again, thats something thats, I think, very unique to software businesses where when theyre successful, they are so economically successful that the amount of money, the total dollars raised, is such a small amount relative to the intrinsic value of recurring revenue business.
 Its really then, for me, as Ive been trying to think about ways to navigate a private investing program, I think that a this is a feature that I will continue to seek out, but b it really distorts pricing.
 Yes, we have had a bit of a reset from a fund flows perspective.
 But the secular trend, as more institutional dollars come into the theme of software eating the world, and as these liquidation preferences are in place, the price, the way that like you said, if this was a public investment, how would you price the cant lose money and then whats the upside?
 It really gets distorted.
 It doesnt seem like something thats fully taken into consideration in the market.
 Its fun.
 Lets jam on this little bit.
 This is one of those secrets hiding in plain sight that I dont think its talked about enough.
 Id hoped that we might go there in the interview we did with Howard and Andrew Marks that came out a little bit ago on Acquired.
 When I asked Howard about the differences between public market investing, which is a highly efficient market and all that in private market investing, I was hoping we would touch on this feature of at least venture private market investing.
 Youre absolutely right.
 The concept of preferred equity is, to my mind, a huge reason why there are outsized returns to be had in private market investing versus public market investing.
 Now, access is a bigger one for sure, privileged information, rights.
 All of that is true, but this is certainly a piece of the puzzle for me.
 For me personally, in my own activities and you as an LP, why do I feel good about committing large portions of my net worth, my time, and energy to investing in private market technology companies versus public market technology companies, which many of the same features of still in cases be plenty of upsides left, infinite liquidity, and all of that?
 This is one of the features that is a big feather in the cap for private market investing.
 It definitely is.
 Its been peculiar to me that it hasnt been talked about as a distorting factor in valuations.
 Ive been digging into this more recently.
 I was going down a Twitter rabbit hole just searching liquidation preference and other similar terms to see how people are talking about this.
 A lot of the secondary platforms like Forge, pricing, common, and preferred equity, they end up trading way closer in price to one another than I would expect.
 When companies go public, there almost always is, as going public, the preferred converts into common.
 I understand that that point of convergence does exist.
 Depending on the scenario.
 On paper, the benefits of this, the investors are larger than they actually are because it only applies to an MA scenario.
 If a company were to go public, then the preference gets wiped away.
 Actually, Ive seen this way back in the early days of my venture career.
 You can get a management team and an investor base at strong odds of incentives here where if a management team thinks that they can take upsay, theyve raised money at a valuation that is no longer reasonable, the intrinsic valuation of the company should be much lower.
 If the management team thinks that they could actually get an IPO through, get public, and get liquid, their strong incentive is to do that versus to sell the company, even at the equivalent price, especially at the equivalent price because if you sell the company, the investors get a much larger share of the proceeds because of the preference.
 You go public, the preference gets wiped and everybody shares equally.
 Yeah.
 I think that thats something that you certainly have to express the view here.
 Vanta has raised the .
 billion valuation.
 If they go public and the price is less than that, then you dont have the protections of that liquidation preference.
 As an investor, Im asking myself, what are the series of next best alternatives that Christina might have?
 Does this company go public in a variety of worlds where they are under a .
 billion valuation, which is basically just at the end of the day, is there enough gas in this tank that Im pretty confident that we can get within the next couple of years to that threshold?
 I very much believe that they will.
 I think that as more capital comes into earlier stage, technologyenabled assets, and I look at myself as a Sherpa kind of fostering those flows, having the liquidation preference is really helpful.
 What are downsides of having liquidation preferences?
 Does this end up operating something like debt in an organization?
 I dont think functionally.
 We should talk about ratchets in a sec here.
 I think for a standard liquidation preference like this, like I said, Ive seen it in my career where you couldnt get a company in management.
 Common shareholders at odds with preferred shareholders over companies viable, but not as viable as thought.
 In that case, it was a very capitalintensive company that had raised a lot of money.
 Again, never say never.
 Im sure this will happen in cases and has happened.
 But in a software company, its pretty hard because its not the valuation that matters with the liquidation preference.
 Its the amount of capital raised.
 Lets take Vanta here.
 Round numbers, lets say it all and be about million that theyve raised.
 Thats the preference stack.
 Whether the valuation was million or .
 billion as it actually is in this round, billion, billion, or whatever, that doesnt matter.
 Its getting the dollars back to the investors.
 For arguments sake, lets say Vanta had raised at a billion valuation, but only had million that it had raised for company X.
 The billion valuation had raised million total of capital.
 If the company had an opportunity to exit for billion, thats obviously way lower than the valuation in an MA exit, but the investors would get their million of capital back.
 For software companies that scale so efficiently, as you say, its not like that big a deal.
 Ratchets are whats interesting.
 I wonder if well start to see this coming back.
 This had happened in the mid teens era where people were unsure about economic inflation a little bit back then.
 Square is the most famous example.
 Their last one or two private rounds at Square had raised these dynamics were talking about, but the extra feature of a ratchetand what a ratchet is its basically saying this dynamic applies both in an IPO and in MA.
 Liquidation preference is usually just MA.
 If you go public, the preference gets wiped out.
 But a ratchet says no, no, it stays.
 If you were to go public at a lower valuation than this round, investors essentially get their money back through a variety of mechanisms.
 Interesting.
 Yeah, I think that thats what Im probably most looking forward to about this ongoing and continuing phase of the capital formation cycle, just as a practitioner, learning about the features that come and go over time and increasingly kind of using those as tools and as ways of also charting where we are in this capital cycle.
 I think its going to be really interesting.
 Its interesting, the ratchets got a really bad rap in that era, and Im not exactly sure why.
 If you think through it as objectively as possible, early stage investors hated them, which I think is why they got a bad rap.
 Because if youre an early stage investor in a company like this, lets take Square, for example, that ratchet can really hurt you.
 It can cause you to suffer a lot more dilution at the IPO, which youre already probably not happy about dilution of the IPO, but youll suffer even more because of a ratchet.
 I think a lot of early stage investors got very vocal about hating them back then.
 But like anything, its a term, its a feature.
 Youre providing further downside protection to a new investor in exchange for a combination of a higher valuation and more importantly, more concretely, probably more capital getting put into the business.
 Im not sure its actually that bad.
 The management team kind of sits somewhere in the middle.
 If you want to go deeper, we can discuss their motivations too.
 It just depends on the circumstances.
 The specifics matter in terms of where the business is, what that marginal dollar might accomplish if raised.
 I think one of the things I really like here is, and Ive heard this from some investors that have partnered with Vanta where they like to be involved because they think that Christina isnt going to be a founder that has multiple acts in her, which I dont know whether that has basis or not.
 But the point being that her next best alternatives, I think a lot about next best alternatives.
 What does that look like for her?
 Its going to be a very high bar that she has to continue to put her lifes work into Vanta.
 I feel like when it gets to a point that she might think that doing something else is more attractive, getting the highest value, and having that be a datainformed decision that happens earlier rather than later, I think is something that when I go into thinking about who the people are that are involved, their next best alternative is a really key input for what I think that they might do in the future.
 Yup, great.
 Do you want to move on to grading?
 Oh, yeah.
 How do you want to grade this?
 I think it needs to be forwardlooking.
 What does really bad look like?
 An F is that this category that Vanta Everything we were just talking about actually becomes irrelevant, which I really think is unlikely.
 I think that it is as well, but I want to do this for posteritys sake.
 As a professional hedge fund manager for a long time, my premortems and postmortems looked like translating Hebrew to Chinese.
 The unknown unknowns were so often the dominant fundamental factor that I should have been paying attention to.
 I think for me, theres some posterity value in doing this.
 What does really bad look like from here?
 Maybe well go back to the Geoffrey Moore mindset.
 At an infrastructure level, I have a hard time manufacturing risks at a software eating the world level.
 Where the risks start to manifest is creating the category doesnt mean that you continue to own it.
 In fact, it attracts a lot of competitors.
 Some of the competitors are very strong.
 Also, there are large behemoths that control a lot of data and workflow adjacent to Vanta.
 There are scenarios where growth slows dramatically.
 It ends up being a public comp kind of valuation of something and the four to six times revenue multiple.
 I think that fortunately for Vanta, a slower growth environment would likely result in the company having pretty good cash flow margins.
 There is downside, absolutely, to that .
 billion valuation.
 Is there a downside to the ?
 No, I think that thats hard to get there.
 To your point though, also about that little bit of a sidebar, but I just learned something the other day that blew my mind, which is that, to your point about large incumbent software companies that might want to enter a space, I learned about a new software, a new product, cloud software, application software product from Microsoft that they launched months ago that is now doing .
 billion dollars in annualized revenue.
 I was just like, holy crap, thats so crazy impressive that Microsoft can still do that and does that.
 Man, its so awesome.
 Microsoft probably wasnt doing that.
 Yes, of course, its distribution that does that.
 Their ability to see, its like the Eye of Sauron in Lord of the Rings.
 To see that opportunity and be like mine, .
 of ARR, no time flat.
 It is a very challenging part of investing in an ecosystemdriven internet services world.
 I was very bullish on Slack.
 Actually, I think, one of the few private investments that we made at the fund where I worked, were users, and we loved it so much.
 It transformed talking about a system of engagement.
 But holy hell, Microsofts ability to pour water on the Slack fire was really remarkable.
 I think thats a piece here that I feel a little bit more comfortable just given the nature of this being an aggregation layer.
 Very few companies are mono cloud.
 As long as that digital estate has a lot of heterogeneity, as long as you have Azure, AWS, GCP, a suite of cloud services that go into building your infrastructure, I think that this is relatively insulated from the big scary platform competitors.
 What does a middling outcome look like?
 I think they continue to grow north of rate for the next year or so, but then that stair steps down to maybe or so in two years.
 I dont think we actually said that.
 I wont say the actual numbers, but the revenue growth rate in the air, our growth rate for Vanta is unbelievably impressive.
 Truly, truly top tier, one of the best Ive seen in my whole career, which is awesome.
 Thats another feather in the companys cap.
 It is.
 As businesses grow so quickly, the bar for exceptional growth, I think it just has to go up.
 As you think about continuing to refine your investment thesis for the environment that youre operating inI remember when I first got into software, a rule of company was really good.
 Rule of means recurring revenue growth plus the cash flow margin that theyre able to earn.
 Vanta is rule of well into the triple digits.
 Well into the triple digits, yes.
 Which is exciting.
 I think that having that be a durably high number and that really being a function of a datainformed decision, that is making those returnoriented investments into the business and having a forced rank way of prioritizing capital.
 This is really a capital allocation exercise that Christina and team are working towards.
 In any case, for a middling outcome, I think that they continue to dominate in SOC .
 They find ways of appending the SOC product with some PCI compliance, maybe some HIPAA, SarbanesOxley.
 I think that piece for me is going to be really important.
 Right now, their net retention rate is good, but I want to see it improve over the coming quarters.
 They dont have a good expansion product flow.
 Its like, you buy Vanta, the expansion is you add more compliance certificates.
 Its not a usagebased expansion right now, which as you say, can be a doubleedged sword in a tough environment.
 But generally, usagebased expansion is great.
 Yeah.
 I think that the middling situation is where they kind of stay in the system of record world.
 They have some expansion, but not a lot.
 In three years, its million something.
 You probably get to that .
 billion valuation.
 Maybe you can get kind of a return from here, and its a fine investment.
 What I would say also though is something challenging right now.
 When you have dislocation in the market, there are lots of purchase decisions you can make right now that might look like exceptional investments.
 The bar is pretty high on a relative basis.
 Again, bringing in that liquidation preference really does kind of help justify the investment, even in the case where its something of a middling outcome.
 What does an A look like here?
 An A looks like standing up compliance automation as a major pillar within the digital estate.
 So something like a CRM or service management like what ServiceNow has built, or even observability like Datadog is in the process of building out.
 In that scenario, you end up ingesting upstream processes, creating a visualization and engagement layer that really hones in on the core risk profile of a business.
 I want to add one thing that really could get me super excited for that A.
 When I think about whats the information that exists in a business that could really tell me something about its DNA, about its culture, about its likelihood to execute and win large markets, it does have to do with the insight that Vanta captures.
 If they can find ways of translating the data that theyre ingesting into something of a communication to the outside world about what that company is, kind of almost along the lines of like what an SP or a Moodys do for assessing financial stability.
 If Vanta can become a way of communicating operational stability and excellence, I think that there is a sundry of ways of creating and capturing value.
 A billion dollar company.
 That world is not out of the question.
 Thats the thing that when Im daydreaming, which I do sometimes, is how I love the way you phrased it earlier.
 I think, really, a great way to capture what youre talking about is, can Vanta cross the chasm from a system of record to a system of engagement?
 If they can do that, yes, the system of engagement around security compliance and data security monitoring is going to be an enormous market.
 Again, with the usual caveat of, I cant be sure about anything anymore, but Im pretty sure that thats going to be an enormous market.
 Yes.
 All right, listeners, thank you for joining us on this episode.
 Our huge thanks to the Solana Foundation.
 Come hang out with us in Lisbon at Solana Breakpoint.
 Dave and I will both be there on stage doing a live show.
 Were very excited about that.
 Lastly, please take the Acquired Annual Survey.
 We ask delightful questions like what do you do for a living?
 How big is your company?
 And other fan favorites, such as, did you become a customer of any of our wonderful sponsors all year?
 We would really appreciate you helping us out by filling that out and win some sweet prizes.
 All right, listeners, well see you next time.
 Well see you next time.
  may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate andor amusing transcription errors Welcome to season six episode four of Acquired.
 All right, listeners.
 We are coming to you in a time of enormous change and upheaval.
 The Coronavirus has spread around the world, challenging global health systems, bringing economies to their knees, and changing daily life for everyone seemingly overnight.
 Given this, it just seems irresponsible to stay business as usual over here and put on our normal Acquired episodes for you all.
 Were changing Acquired.
 For the first time ever, were taking a pause from normal episodes.
 The world doesnt need Acquired right now.
 People normally tune in to hear us talk about stories behind great technology companies and what goes into building them, but these arent normal times.
 What the world does need right now are stories of great leaders and how they in their organizations are responding to what might be the biggest moment of change weve ever seen.
 Were going to take everything that we put into Acquired over the years, our format, our infrastructure, and the way we can reach all of you and were going to put our full weight behind this.
 Starting today, were pausing Acquired and we are launching, Adapting.
 Adapting is a series all about doing just that, showing leadership and changing to fit what the world needs right now, not what it needed last week.
 With adapting, were going to take a more shallow dive at the beginning of each episode into the history of an organization, but our focus is really going to be on the present and on the future, not the past.
 We also wont be grading, adapting requires taking risks and putting yourself out there, and anyone whos doing that right now is forever an A in our book.
 Yeah.
 David, I think we were just talking about this, but Im excited about this.
 It just feels right at this moment to do this.
 Totally.
 Listeners, we are making some important changes to the Acquired community.
 If you havent joined our Slack, you can sign up on the Acquired website and find all the announcements there.
 Were doing some new and pretty cool things in there.
 If youre not yet a limited partner, now is the time to join.
 In addition to LP episodes, we are adding a community component to the LP program.
 Last week, we had our first group zoom call with everyone whos shutin at home.
 It was really fun and therapeutic to get to talk with everyone, so we decided to make it a regular monthly thing as part of the limited partner program.
 Well be announcing more details on that in the LP show.
 In the meantime, you can signup at glow.
fmacquired by clicking the link in the show notes below.
 Lastly, David and I feel very strongly that money should never be a reason that a single person cant become an Acquired LP.
 We were talking about this beforehand, especially when introducing this new community hangout component.
 If you cant afford a subscription, especially as we all respond to this pandemic together, even if you already are an LP, just shoot us an email, introduce yourself, and well take care of you.
 Yeah, we feel super strongly about this.
 We want everyone who wants to be part of this community to be able to, so shoot us a note.
 Yup.
 We owe an enormous thank you to our banner sponsor, Silicon Valley Bank.
 David, do you want to talk about SVB this time since were changing everything?
 Totally.
 This is new uncharted waters for Acquired here.
 SVB has always been the bank of the innovation economy.
 By the way, they didnt write this.
 We wrote this and its times like this that really becomes clear.
 Theyve been just an incredible partner to us at Acquired here since day one, and at this moment have been beyond supportive of us.
 We emailed them, and we told them about our plans for the changes we wanted to make here, and their response was an instant, Yes.
 How can we help?
 Were super lucky to have them as partners, and every entrepreneur whos listening right now should feel the same.
 Heres the message they did ask us to Innovation happens when status quo solutions wont do.
 As the world fights COVID, Silicon Valley Bank pays tribute to all the innovators, healthcare providers, scientists, social workers, takeout chefs, policymakers, philanthropists, generous driven individuals working around the clock to keep people alive, find a cure, and help the world cope with the unimaginable.
 Silicon Valley Bank supports innovative companies and their investors and has for more than years.
 It knows that innovation requires adaptability, flexibility, and unrelenting passion for finding solutions.
 Today, more than ever, SVB salutes innovators everywhere.
 Learn more at svb.
comnext.
 Amen and thank you, guys.
 Yeah, thank you to SVB.
 Now, what is todays episode actually about?
 Well, we are doing an episode on a topic that we never thought we would do on the show.
 A local restaurant.
 But it is so much more than that.
 Indeed.
 We think our guests words are very inspiring and super important today.
 Without further ado, please enjoy our conversation with Mark Canlis of Seattles Canlis Restaurant.
 All right, listeners, most of you are aware that restaurants are among those hit the hardest from our current health crisis.
 Canlis is leading the way in adapting to provide a product in delivery food.
 Saving jobs and ensuring the continuation of the business through trying times.
 Many are asking as a city, country, and a global community, Can we do this?
 As Mark said in the Seattle Times earlier this week, Hell, yes, we can do this and were going to do it with burgers and bagels.
 To introduce Mark, Im going to borrow a little bit of Marks bio from the Canlis website because I find the prose just poetic.
 Mark Canlis is the second of three sons.
 He grew up in a restaurant family.
 He joined Canlis in after graduating from Cornell University and serving as a captain in Air Force Special Operations.
 He met his wife, Anne Marie, while opening famed restaurateur Danny Meyers fifth restaurant, Blue Smoke in Manhattan.
 Returning to Seattle, Mark spearheaded the generational transfer and brand modernization that has garnered the family business national acclaim as one of the finest restaurants in America.
 He now owns and operates Canlis with his brother Brian.
 He and Anne Marie reside on Queen Anne with their three children.
 As for Canlis, Food Wine Magazine has called it one of the most important restaurants in the last years.
 They have received consecutive Wine Spectator Grand Awards, been nominated for James Beard Awards, and won of them.
 Welcome, Mark.
 Thank you.
 Its good to be here.
 Also, the luxury of when you write your own bio, you can make yourself sound good.
 I hope I havent inflated that in any way, but thank you.
 I was gonna say the most important thing for Ben and for me is both of us have had many special memories at Canlis, so thank you, guys.
 No.
 Im honored to be on the show.
 All right, David, take us in history and facts.
 For anybody of our listeners who are in the Seattle area even many who arent, you already know a lot about Canlis.
 Mark, can you give us a little bit of the history?
 Its a very special place this isnt just another restaurant.
 Can you go back and talk about your grandfathers story in Hawaii and Pearl Harbor?
 Sure.
 If were going to go all the way back, I run this restaurant with my brother, Brian, and we very much feel like this is the tale of a couple of different grandfathers.
 Its the amalgamation of four generations of Canlises doing restaurants.
 Our great grandfather cooked for Teddy Roosevelt after his presidency on an African Safari.
 He was picked up at a hotel in Egypt and invited to come along and be a steward on that whole thing for  years.
 Really, it starts there.
 He and my great grandmother would come to the United States somewhere around .
 They started a restaurant in Stockton, California at that time and had a bunch of kids.
 One of them, Peter Canlis, started his restaurant Canlis in .
 That was my grandfather, he would pass away in the s, and my mom and dad ran this for years.
 Brian and I have not been doing it since .
 In so many ways, we feel like were just getting the hang of it, so slow learners.
 More or less years of trying to cook for people.
 Theres a pretty cool military history with the restaurant and starting with Peter, too, right?
 Yeah.
 Then on the other side of the family are a whole bunch of folks who have served in the armed forces.
 That just continues to be something that were really proud of as a family, something that many of us have chosen to do, and represent some of the sweetest years, at least for my own life.
 I would say that the same is true for my dad, my grandfather, and my brother.
 I was in the Air Force with Brian.
 Dad was the Navy.
 My grandfather was a marine for years.
 I dont know if you can do that anymore, but back then you could.
 Thats just been a part of our family story.
 To be completely honest, a very large influence on the way that we lead.
 Yesterday, were running this crazy drivethrough, weve got cars everywhere, shut down traffic, and I get a phone call.
 Im hearing it so that the thing just comes straight into my head as if the phone is ringing in your brain.
 I just answered it because I thought it was our road team, and it was the colonel that I worked for years ago.
 Colonel Mueller, the man that just had such a remarkable influence on the way that I lead.
 It was random, I havent talked to him in years and I was like, Colonel Mueller, no way.
 Ive been talking about you to everyone because in so many ways I feel like you prepared me for this.
 Its not about adapting your company but the leadership, the way the military teaches you to your people.
 I just learned so much in my time in the service.
 Thats just been a gift to us.
 Thats great.
 The first iteration of Canlis the restaurant was in Honolulu, grew out of the USO after Pearl Harbor, right?
 He left the place in Stockton hed grown up there, wanted nothing to do with restaurants with the way his parents were doing, and he ended up in Hawaii.
 Hes still on dry goods when Pearl Harbor happens, you remember zeros flying over, he was playing tennis in the morning.
 Like everybody, like so many people in Honolulu at the time all headed to the base, tried to do what they could.
 My grandfather had quite a healthy selfesteem.
 He sounds like an entrepreneur.
 Yeah, there you go.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, thats a nice euphemism for a large ego, and at some point, he finds himself talking a lot of smack inside the USO about the quality of the food.
 The chef gets so upset that he throws the towel and says, You need to get a better job.
 You try it, which of course he does.
 By the end of the war, hes running all of the food on base for the USO.
 Its between and meals.
 Maybe in some way, this drivethrough is us getting back to our high volume of roots if you will.
 Thats what happened, and then right after the war, opened a restaurant on a beach that was a little less known before the war, and certainly then before now called Waikiki.
 He had a restaurant in called The Broiler and then he came to Seattle in .
 Mark, just a context for our listeners a little bit when you say getting back to our high volume roots.
 For folks not from Seattle, Canlis is fine, fine dining.
 What does normal volume look like and what does the adapted volume look like?
 I dont know.
 I feel like I live in a bubble and I dont really understand the real restaurant business.
 Lets just try to understand fine dining for a second because I think its a funny term.
 We consider fine dining just to be the most considered form of caring for somebody with food and hospitality.
 For us, were considered to be a massive fine dining restaurant in the world of fine dining.
 Twelve to fifteen tables are pretty standard.
 We have .
 On a busy night, the most guests we can serve are somewhere around .
 I have employees to make that happen.
 We are a model of inefficiency.
 Thats just six diners a week thats all were doing.
 I say that because I just want people to know.
 Not open for breakfast, not open for lunch?
 No.
 Yeah, people to figure out dinner.
 There are a couple of hours a day where theres someone not there, but when you talk about people, its like AM to bake bread or something.
 Four hours a day we dont use our kitchen.
 It takes us hours to open for what is essentially five hours of dinnertime service.
 A lot of prep obviously goes into that.
 Youre baking bread and setting things up, sometimes it takes a couple of days to make, but today we served about people through the drivethrough.
 We served about somewhere in the range of people for breakfast.
 Tonight, well send a couple of hundred dinners out for delivery.
 Its a much different impact for us.
 I dont know exactly set up for it, so were trying to figure that out as we go.
 Today was a day of rest for us.
 Every day this week, weve opened a new restaurant concept.
 We started on Monday with a drivethrough.
 Tuesday, we added bagels and yesterday we added home delivery.
 Today we were just refining some of those systems again, and it was nice just to run them and see how we could tweak it.
 Lets get right into this show Adapting.
 Its now years that your family has run Canlis fine dining, and in weeks really since you started planning, youve thrown that out the window and now youre doing these different things.
 When was the moment you realized that this was gonna happen and you needed to change?
 A couple of weeks ago now, my wife and I were in New York City doing something for the James Beard Awards.
 We got the news that Seattle had its first case.
 We went back to the hotel and just talking through like this things coming.
 Its here.
 Its here in Seattle.
 What does that mean?
 What does that mean for our family?
 What does it mean for not just our marriage and our own children, but our extended family?
 I have parents who are in their s.
 What does that mean for the restaurant family, for the staff?
 A couple of days later, back at home, we had a meeting as a team and we just said, Guys, lets really think through this a little bit.
 While we were having that meeting, the King County governor or some official announced they had this live stream that came on and said, Hey, this is a much bigger deal than we thought.
 At first, its like the sucker punch to the system.
 Youve got the wind taken out of you a little bit.
 Pretty quickly, we realized that it would be just as risky to do nothing as it would to do something really radical.
 If we were going to live into our values every once a while, that really is probably going to cost you something and in this way, it was going to cost shutting down while were still a profitable business for the unknown of opening up three new ones.
 The reason were doing this is it took that many ideas to get all of my staff up to having all the hours that would have normally had and that was the goal here.
 We started with the drivethrough.
 For those that dont know, were a fine dining restaurant looking this direction, but if you turn around, were on a really busy road, and thats not ideal.
 No one would plan it out these days.
 We just said what do we have?
 Starting with what do we have to be thankful for?
 What assets are at our disposal here if we started from scratch?
 And how would we play this?
 I remember watching the live stream, were all huddled on the couch, there is the team, there are seven of us.
 In this meeting.
 This is in the meeting, we do these threehoursoff sites, and we go to somebodys homes, so we can feel what its like to be welcomed into their home personally.
 Were sitting on the sofa, which is not a sevenperson sofa.
 Its a three or fourperson sofa.
 Were all huddled and watching this thing.
 I think it just hit us that the game isnt up.
 Wait a second, this isnt over.
 This is just beginning, and I think wed all gone in with the sentiments of helplessness, if were honest, maybe hopelessness.
 I think there was a feeling of, I got to batten down the hatches.
 I got to hunker down.
 I got to Protect, yeah.
 Protect, and thats a lousy strategy in a lot of things, soccer being one of them.
 You see in sports all the time when an entire team switches to defense and loses their offense.
 Suddenly, youre like, Ah, dont do that.
 Wait a minute.
 Keep playing your game.
 For us, if were going to keep playing our game, we just need to admit to the game change.
 The game now, currently today, was no one understands the sixfoot rule and no one understands what is socially acceptable.
 We dont understand if we should be shutting down schools and public places, or if that is building a fear.
 This is happening so quickly but so we just said, Well today, what we know right now You know what that moment that the game had changed?
 We just got the sense that it was going to.
 It hadnt yet, but the writings on the wall.
 Nobody wanted to actually say that out loud, but it felt that way a couple of weeks ago.
 I can tell you from the outside the way it felt is you made a more drastic move earlier than most places.
 I think in the next week, a lot of places started trying to figure out what it means for us to do delivery, but I will say from the outside the way it looked and frankly, part of what inspired David and I for this was, Oh, my God.
 That was decisive.
 That was severe and extreme.
 And risky.
 I wish I could take credits for that.
 Let me tell you where a lot of that credit belongs.
 First off, we have an incredible board of directors and some advisors who are just remarkable sounding boards for us.
 Both of our wives were really key into speaking into how we were perceiving the world.
 I think in this time, it was a time of just great perception, trying to understand and make sense of what we were hearing.
 How it pertained to us and our team.
 When we launched this with the executive team, we said, This thing could work.
 Thats to say, Theres a chance the boat is taking on water, and theres a chance it might sink.
 Also, theres a chance of a lifeboat on the end.
 Will someone just go to the end of the ship and see if theres a lifeboat?
 Thats what that meeting felt like.
 Somebody came back and said, It turns out there was a lifeboat on the back of the ship.
 We could all get in it, right?
 I was like, Huh.
 We sat on that as a team for about hours.
 Two days later, I was having dinner with our staff and were all sitting around having a family meal talking this through.
 I just said, Guys, let me just tell you where my heads at.
 Im scared to tell you because I dont know what it means, but this is what were thinking about as a team.
 It would mean all of you need to revolunteer to work here.
 It would mean all of you choosing to be in a position, choosing not to be laid off, or temporarily furloughed, choosing to actually continue to do this thing.
 Would any of you be interested?
 Not only that group of five or six of us sitting around the table but the next night in a staff meeting, announcing it to the entire team, This is up to you and you dont have to do this, and every one of them saying, Were in.
 Put me in coach.
 I think that was just such a boost of encouragement to us like, If you guys are in, were in.
 Lets do this.
 It had that sentiment to it.
 I was like, Okay, why not?
 I think at some point, you say to yourself in any time of crisis, If I have the ability to help, why am I not doing it?
 That is what it felt like to us.
 It felt like this could be an encouragement to the city.
 It was clearly an encouragement to the staff, and is for us, just a way through.
 A way that untested, untried way, but we thought wed give it a whirl.
 Thats awesome.
 Cool.
 I want to talk about communication and language.
 Ive always used the language you guys used, but particularly now, its inspiring.
 Before we get to that, can we go back to the three concepts you guys are doing?
 Breakfast, the bagel shed, drivethrough lunch, and then delivery for dinner.
 Where did they come from?
 Theres also a fourth concept coming, which Im super stoked about.
 I can walk you through all three of those.
 The first one was the drivethrough.
 We saw that as being the biggest revenue generator.
 We have a ridiculous amount of labor here.
 Its the most expensive thing and we knew that one of these concepts had actually worked.
 Geographically, if you understand the way this restaurant works, you can pull right off of the street right under our park cashier.
 You can stay in your car and you can roll right down the driveway, and it was like thats what we knew we needed for the cleanliness there, the ability to not have any contact with the guest, but still be facing them.
 We were embracing our inner drivethrough as a fine dining restaurant.
 It was just like, Guys, this is us, come on, lets just let it out of the bag.
 Chef can cook a remarkable burger and weve always joked about doing this traditional salad of ours, the Canlis salad.
 Its a togo item and why not?
 Lets just do burgers, ice cream, sandwiches, and salad to go.
 Sometimes thats all you need.
 Can you talk about the average ticket price for each of these three concepts?
 Burger fries are .
 We have designed this thing not to make money.
 I dont think theres anything unethical about making money at this time.
 In a certain sense, we have a duty to do so.
 Mostly as a means of protecting the staff and to be clear, were only four days in.
 I dont know if we are thats to say.
 The bagel concept clearly does not make money.
 Its laborintensive.
 We dont have the equipment to scale that in any way such that we could move that to be a profitable business.
 We could raise the prices but that just feels dirty.
 The point is to keep people employed.
 With burgers, we probably make a little extra.
 With bagels, were definitely losing.
 With dinner, as we scale that up, thatll be profitable and somehow if we can get to break even.
 Even from the onset, thats what the goal was.
 It was like itd be amazing if for the next three months Canlis could not lose money.
 I think thatll posture us really well coming out of this thing on the other side.
 I do think of it as a few months, not just a few weeks.
 Bagels came out with the idea of four, were gonna be really busy for lunch.
 Our expediter happens to be this incredible woman from the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
 Shes a baker and she makes a ridiculous bagel.
 The chef is from Brooklyn and she was like, Thats the best bagel Ive had in New York City or in Seattle.
 We happen to have a bread oven and a shipping container and it was a no brainer.
 So, we just opened the bagel shed and were doing everything bagels with fried eggs, homemade sausage, and cheese.
 Can you sell the bagels as an add on to dinner for breakfast at home the next morning?
 Thats what we say.
 That would be a good idea.
 We sell out of bagels in under an hour.
 Its a fulltime crew of eight making these things and that whole idea lasts an hour.
 We actually thought about intentionally slowing the line.
 The idea is to keep everyone employed there here, but now weve been blowing through them too quickly.
 Right now were looking at taking over another bakery that is closed and maybe we can use their space and scale.
 Were going to hire someone there.
 I did see something.
 Its a message on your website this morning like, Unfortunately, bagels are sold out as of AM.
 Yeah.
 They have begun going out.
 The last concept is just doing family meals at home.
 We cook an amazing family meal for the staff.
 Thats the meal.
 About twice a day, the chef prepares for our team.
 We always joke, like one of the best restaurants in the city actually being Canlis is a family meal, like its so good that pastry chef is making cobblers, the bartenders are making homemade sodas, and the chef is like, Hey, this is my mamas meatloaf and this is enchilada from Nicos, and prepping all day.
 Its so good and it kills us the rest of the city doesnt get to see what these guys are capable of outside of fine dining.
 We just thought, Okay, well, thats a no brainer.
 Why dont we just keep making family meals?
 We dont need a big menu.
 Delivery is tough to figure out when making a transition like this.
 If you can keep it simple, you should.
 We offer one thing a night.
 The very first night it was cassoulet because we had all these dried ducks.
 Im like, What do we do with ducks?
 More regular farms saying, Are you going to take delivery of ducks going forward?
 and were going to say yes.
 Tonight it is a rabbit pot pie and glazed carrots.
 I had it for lunch.
 Its insane.
 Its so good.
 We just thought, Shoot, we can bake all that stuff here, pack it up, throw a bottle of wine in it.
 My servers who used to take food from the kitchen to the table are now just taking it to the parking lot right on down the street a little way.
 It keeps them employed and it keeps my kitchen cooking all night long, and its fun.
 Thats so cool.
 Technically, how did you make that happen?
 Youve been on Tock reservation and ticketing system for a while.
 Did you work with Tock to make this happen?
 The guys at Tock were awesome.
 We call them early on and were like, We have this crazy idea.
 Were actually trying to hack the system.
 Tock is a reservation system for those that dont know those guys are awesome.
 Were trying to see if we get more through the reservation system into a delivery system.
 We just about figured out and they called like, You guys stop it.
 Hold on a second.
 We can do this.
 Give us five minutes.
 Five minutes later, they called back and they said, We stood our company down, were turning it back on, we just called everybody in here in Chicago.
 Were just going to work on this, so you have the platform.
 They cranked it out working around the clock for a couple of days and we were able to launch.
 That is a mechanism that any restaurant in the country could.
 Not everybody can do drivethrough and just the physicality of it.
 The location isnt going to work, but any restaurant a company could do delivery and now that weve got the software for it, its not overly tricky.
 Can you talk through any restaurant in the country that can do delivery?
 Im sure theres a lot of folks that own restaurants that are listening to this.
 What does that take?
 It takes a lot of guts and it takes just that good old fashioned restaurant scrappiness that every restaurateur already has.
 If youre in this business, I guarantee you have what it takes.
 Its just the same thing it takes to run a restaurant.
 Its that.
 Its a little bit of the willpower just to make it happen.
 Thats I think what all of us are going through.
 All we did was figure out a menu and we launched a website, so someone that knows what to do on the Internet.
 Thats not me, but our design team drew up a little logo which is not necessary.
 We threw a little splash page on top of canlis.
com which is also not necessary.
 You could just post on Instagram, Having to switch to delivery, so appreciate you supporting us doing this.
 You can do various versions of it.
 Ours is pretty fancy, our servers have it on their phones, they get the maps, they get the texts, we can do dropoffs, no contact dropoffs, we can do alcohol.
 Tock made all that possible, but you can keep it really simple.
 It takes ordering some boxes and some togo containers coming up with one thing that holds hot really well and letting your constituency know tonights a great night for takeout.
 We sold out nights worth of takeout in about minutes.
 Wow.
 One question that I have that Id be remiss if I didnt ask, and Ill give a little context for listeners.
 Canlis is innovative, not just in the way that over the last years you guys have changed fine dining, which we havent talked about on this episodeMark has given some great talks that you can read about, the evolution of fine dining and Canlis is rolling itbut also in doing these wild experiments that you would not expect the finest dining in the city to also have a shake shack pop up in the parking lot before there was a shake shack.
 Can we uncover that a little bit?
 Do you mind if we dig into why you wouldnt expect fine dining restaurants to do that?
 Yeah.
 definitely one of the reasons that I think this transition has been possible for us is that we practice this kind of thing.
 By that, I dont just mean events in our parking lot.
 If you want to be a restaurant that is around let alone relevant to the conversation, youre doing a fair amount of this every year anyway, people always ask Brian and I, How come you guys havent opened a second restaurant?
 Im like, You just dont know it.
 We opened a second restaurant about every months.
 I would say thats how often the systems inside of Canlis are changing.
 Those are being rewritten by new employees and employees that have been here for years.
 The idea is that theres probably a better way to do it than the way that were doing it.
 We just believe that.
 I think if you want to matter, you need to earn that right, and to earn it, you have to be working all the time and opening a restaurant thats really good.
 Tonight, were good.
 Tomorrow will be better.
 Thats not news to anyone.
 Thats not a strategy that no ones heard before.
 If youre in business, you get it, and maybe thank you to the Japanese who have made that a very popular concept in the late s and s, but were all thinking that way.
 What happens is its really easy to get lazy.
 Its really easy to start to devalue that as the thing is working, and of course, if you go too far that maybe youre undoing things that still had a useful lifespan inside of that.
 I hate to take a system down that would have been an amazing foreseeable future.
 That takes a little sorting through.
 You got to be careful there but were proffering the business, so its a delicate balance.
 Unless listeners think that were just talking about a onetime thing opening up a shake shack.
 I went to your restaurant last summer.
 When I say restaurant, I mean parking lot for the Hawaiian Nights Luau.
 Its the largest hot tub youve ever seen.
 Its up on a second story deck overlooking.
 You guys opened a little pizza shop.
 One of the swimup bars which we created.
 We built a couple of Tiki huts.
 Am I right, you bought a swimming pool on Amazon?
 No.
 Wed like to test things out on staff parties and the goal of a staff party is to throw one that the staff would willingly come to if they had no association with the restaurant.
 Its a true day off or its a true night off, like do whatever you want.
 Also, were going to throw this party over here, and its totally no expectation.
 At some point, we were throwing a luau.
 We had covered the parking lot in sod.
 Its not cool to throw a party in a parking lot in cement and would it be cool with grass?
 We sodded that thing over and we threw a volleyball party, we had a pig roasting, and somebody said at some point, Why do we go out.
 Who needs a beach?
 We brought sand and then I went on Amazon, Im like, No way you can buy a pool for .
 In the world of staff parties, the staff adds up quickly.
 Anyway, we bought a pool and we filled it up and then it just went from there.
 That was a really successful party and we were thinking about fun things we could do over the summer.
 We thought, Well, why dont we just throw the staff party for the city?
 Honestly, I thought, A few hundred people would come.
 Like who goes to a parking lot at a fine dining restaurant to hang out in an aboveground pool?
 Twelve hundred people came at night.
 It was nuts, and all of them waited an hour or two to get in.
 That caught us by surprise a little bit.
 It was also a ton of fun.
 We got a DJ on top of a shipping container and underneath your bacon, the best pizzas, and the roasting pigs.
 It was tons of fun.
 We do like to think through these things, and I think its a little bit of a good exercise.
 Just because were fine dining, doesnt mean were not thinking of other ideas to do.
 To us, its like the formula one version of putting out a sedan.
 Its like, Why dont we go push this as far as we can?
 Lets see what happens.
 Every one of these projects finds its way back into our menu.
 Every one of these projects influences what we believe about hospitality.
 You need that stuff.
 You need to be inspired by people.
 You need to be inspired by it.
 Thats fun.
 All right.
 Before we finish our conversation with Mark, wed like to thank Wilson Sonsini, the official legal sponsor of season six of Acquired and Adapting.
 Wilson Sonsini is the premier legal advisor to technology, life sciences, and growth enterprises worldwide, as well as the venture firms, private equity firms, and investment banks that finance them.
 Thank you to Wilson Sonsini.
 As we start to wind down here, thats the question on my mind.
 I know its only been four days, but of the three restaurants you talked about and fourth that well keep under wraps for now, what do you think might make its way into Canlis when we live in a normal world again?
 Heres what I hope makes its way into Canlis.
 I hope that what comes out of this is a visual reminder of how alike we all are.
 If theres anything that I think weve learned so far, its that our understanding of the human spirit is limited at best.
 Its only when you come to me and say, Mark, I think you got this, man, I reflect that back to you and say, Look, Ben.
 You got this.
 Thats what happens.
 Something really powerful happens there and the whole mission of this company, which is a really weird mission, is to inspire people to turn toward one another.
 When we saw the disease spreading and I am not talking about COVID, I am talking about the amount of fear, the amount of discouragement.
 When we saw that spreading, and often for really good reasons.
 These are not insignificant days.
 This is an overused but good word, but unprecedented for the entire world to go through something together where no one gets to say, Yeah, it doesnt apply to me.
 When something like that happens, I think we have a responsibility to remind ourselves of the truth.
 The truth is, we dont know what were capable of.
 We the Canlis team, we the city of Seattle, we the United States of America, we the citizens of this rock that were floating around on.
 I hope that we understand that better on the other side of this thing.
 Thats what were learning.
 Thats what were learning inside this building.
 We might not be able to do this tomorrow.
 Maybe this will go for months.
 I dont know, but every day, I tell the team, youre going to want to go home, crawl under your covers, and read your phone.
 It is important to do so.
 But when you wake up the next morning, you go outside.
 You physically go outside of your house, your apartment.
 You look up at the sky and ask yourself the question, Is it still up there or did it fall?
 If its still up there, you can be thankful for that, and you start with what youre thankful for.
 You say, All right, the sky did not fall contrary to the way I feel having read all the headlines.
 Its still out there.
 I hear a bird tweeting, I see a neighbor walking down the street.
 You know what?
 Lets start with what we have, lets go from there, and lets ask ourselves the question, if this is what I have, what can I do with it?
 Maybe what we get out of this whole thing is that as a discipline, as a practice, as a reminder.
 Maybe thats a reminder that we need right now.
 I think its a reminder that I needed.
 I think its a reminder that my team needed and I wish you could feel the difference inside this place, before and after we made this decision, before it was feeling of helplessness, and after it was a feeling of hope, before it was a feeling that the overwhelming weight of this thing was too much, and after, it was the understanding that I had a role to play.
 That even just enduring, even just enduring a little bit, might be my role.
 I think when we tell those stories, then we start to remind ourselves of the truth of who we are as people.
 Thats pretty cool.
 Thats why we wrote on that website, We got this, Seattle.
 It was the most poignant way I could say to a city that needed to hear it, we are capable of making it through.
 Well, I cannot think of a single better way to leave our very first episode of Adapted with that line, so Mark, thank you so much.
 Thanks for having me on the show.
 Anything else you want to tell listeners or tell them where they should go get some great food?
 I do want to tell your listeners something.
 I think they have the ability, even though it doesnt feel this way, to make a difference.
 What weve been talking about here is my restaurant, and you know what you dont have?
 You dont have my restaurant and you probably dont have a restaurant to dismiss this as someone elses story in a city that you dont live in.
 I think it would be great or it would make me sad to hear this and to know that if were crazy enough to give this a whirl, maybe some of your crazy is okay too, and I hope it gives them permission to think optimistically.
 I hope it gives them permission to smile at a neighbor.
 Keep it six feet away, I dont care.
 You can still smile at them.
 Thats not insignificant.
 Its important and its going to take all of us remembering that about ourselves, remembering that that is who we are as a people.
 This is a story about our country and largely, this is a story about well beyond our borders and how alike we all really are.
 Amen.
 Lets all go do not exactly what youre doing, but do what we all can to get this.
 We got this.
 Im not against it.
 I think competition only makes us better, but youre gonna have some stiff competition.
 The burgers are pretty good.
 It is on my calendar to come tomorrow morning, I think hopefully around to the bagel shed and pick one up.
 We love to see you here.
 Thanks so much, Mark.
 Listeners, well catch you for the next one.
 Thanks, guys.
 See you next time.
  may contain unintentionally confusing, inaccurate andor amusing transcription errors Welcome to this episode of Acquired, the podcast about great technology companies and the stories and playbooks behind them.
 Im Ben Gilbert.
 Im David Rosenthal.
 We are your hosts.
 Today, we have for you our first Acquired Short.
 There are some stories that deserve three or more hours to chronicle the entire company history from start to finish.
 But there are also some stories, or perhaps chapters of stories, that can be told in an hour or so.
 In Nintendo part two, I asked David a question.
 How exactly did Sega manage to go from having over half the video game console market in the US with the Sega Genesis to abandoning the console business entirely after Dreamcast in a few short years?
 David, you gave us a quick short answer, but we were both looking at each other afterwards, thinking there is so much more to this story.
 It really does deserve its own episode.
 Frankly, its a nice opportunity for us here at Acquired to take a look at a company that didnt become hugely successful and what the lessons we can learn from that one are.
 We bring you today, the death of Sega.
 This can be a really fun experiment.
 We get to tell this story right.
 Listeners, let us know if you like this, and we might do more of them.
 Yup.
 Let us know in the Slack, acquired.
fmslack.
 It is the best place to discuss episodes after we release them.
 Tons of folks joined after the Nintendo episodes.
 Theres a lot of great video game discussion right now.
 Check out ACQ, our second show with interviews.
 The most recent interview is with David Hsu, the founder and CEO of Retool.
 With that, this show is not investment advice.
 David and I may have investments in the companies we discuss, and this show is for informational and entertainment purposes only.
 We could technically still invest in Sega today.
 Sega Sammy holdings.
 Not quite sure wed want to, but lets get into it.
 Spoilers.
 We start our story in around .
 Sega and its Genesis, as it was known in North America, has battled Nintendo and the Super NES to basically a tie in the US home console market, which really in practice, if you go listen to our Nintendo series, was beating the pants off of Nintendo.
 Sega had no right to get to maybe even plus market share, given how far behind they came from.
 Imagine youre a startup and youre fighting some big incumbent, and within three years, you get to a basically market share.
 Its totally nuts.
 The Genesis, it was the cool console in the s.
 It had Sonic.
 Theyve got John Madden Football.
 Theyve got great sports franchises.
 Theyve got the Mortal Kombat version with the blood.
 The real red blood, not the Nintendo toned down gray blood.
 And they have about a million total unit installed base of the Sega Genesis around the world, the vast majority of which about million is in the United States.
 Yeah, and this is basically the best video game consoles were doing at the time.
 Years later, the PlayStation with million, but no one was doing million plus units sold game systems at this point in history, so million rock solid, huge player in the market.
 A great base to build on.
 Also at this time in it has become clear that compact discs are the future, not just for the video game industry, but for everything.
 CD, album sales, and CD players are on their meteoric rise at this point.
 It is a huge driver of business for companies like Sony.
 In the personal computer industry, neighboring to the gaming industry.
 CD ROM drives are now becoming standard in PCs.
 This is how software is shipping.
 This is how games are shipping in the PC industry.
 The trade off with games is, of course, a cartridge doesnt really require a loading time.
 The CD, while it has a ton more storage, does have tradeoffs, where it needs to load stuff onto the machine.
 Yeah, and theres one other really big advantage of the CD medium for the business side of the industry, which is that CDs are much lower cost to produce than cartridges.
 Cartridges, you got to put silicone in there.
 They have chips.
 CDs are just optical discs.
 You can stamp these out for a th, th of the cost of a cartridge.
 Its obvious that the home video game console industry is also going to move to the CD medium as its primary distribution technology going forward.
 The way right now that people in the industry are thinking that this great migration is going to happen is not via new consoles, but via addon peripherals to existing consoles.
 Looking back now, this was obviously a very, very poor path and evolutionary branch of the gaming tree that mercifully died off.
 But at the time, everybody seemed to be doing it.
 There are other consoles like Ataris Jaguar console that came out with a CD ROM addon, the NEC PC entered in Japan.
 In the US, it was called the turbo graphics console, which came out with a CD addon.
 Of course, famously, Nintendo is working on a major partnership that theyve announced, that everybody knows about, with none other than Sony to make a CD ROM addon for the Super Nintendo that would be known as the Play Space Station, the Sony PlayStation addon to the Super Nintendo.
 Well come back to that in a little bit.
 That doesnt go as planned.
 This is now our third episode in addition to Sony and Nintendo, where weve talked about this.
 Of course back Sega, they are working on a CD ROM addon too for the Genesis.
 Just like with the Genesis, they had beaten Nintendo and the Super Nintendo to market with the first bit console.
 They want to make sure that they beat Nintendo and Sony to market with the first CD ROM addon.
 In late they launch the Sega CD addon for the Genesis in North America.
 It comes out with this game called Night Trap, which is a full motion video game thats basically a playable movie.
 Its a really crappy game, but people think that this is the future that CD ROM technology is going to enable.
 Its like a zombieteen horror flick that you basically play as a video game.
 This is one of the games that gets Congress all spun up about, video games are corrupting the youth.
 It leads to the creation of the Entertainment Software Ratings Board, the video game industry version of movie ratings that comes out.
 Rated E for everyone.
 Yeah, exactly.
 Its so funny.
 You go back, look at this stuff today, and compared to Call of Duty, youre like, this is nothing.
 Seriously, Grand Theft Auto.
 Yup.
 Ultimately, despite all this hand wringing over these games and everything coming out with these CD addons, there is a fundamental problem with what Sega is doing here, and that is that addon technology for consoles is never really a good idea because the business model of the video game console industry is a razor and blades model.
 The way that video game companies like Sega, Nintendo, and Sony in a minute, make all of their profits from the software sales, not from the hardware sales.
 You want to have as big of an installed base of consoles as possible to amortize the software sales across.
 When youre selling an addon console, you are limiting the target market to the million people that already own a Genesis.
 It will be smaller by definition than the market base that youve already created.
 This creates a huge problem because then developers dont want to make their best games for a limited install base of consoles.
 Consumers dont want to go buy a platform thats only going to have a very limited number of good games, and it quickly becomes a death spiral.
 The Sega CD sales, despite starting off relatively strong, stall out quickly.
 Sega only sells about million Sega CD units versus the plus million Genesis units that theyve sold.
 This is a flop for them.
 Nintendo, by either luck, skill, or maybe just being slow and Nintendo, they never actually come out with the CD addon for the Super Nintendo, and the Sony partnership falls apart.
 They avoid this disaster that Sega stumbles into.
 After the Sony partnership fell apart, didnt they form a new partnership with Philips to create the Nintendo CD thing?
 They did, but that delayed everything enough that everybody realized that this was a bad idea.
 Nintendo basically also abandoned that project and let Phillips come out with their own console.
 I think it was called the CDI.
 Nobody supported it, it sucked.
 It wasnt part of the Super Nintendo ecosystem.
 Okay, what does Sega do after the Sega Genesis CD addon is abandoned?
 You would think, just like Nintendo did here, you would learn your lesson, console addons are a bad idea, youve got all these problems with it, its a limited market.
 You cut your losses, you move on, and you just embrace the next generation.
 Thats the logical thing to do here, right?
 Yup.
 That is not what Sega does.
 They decide that they are going to follow up their failed console addon with another failed console addon.
 Thats right.
 The infamous and infamously terrible X, which launches in the fall of .
 This is another hardware addon for the Sega Genesis System that you plug into the top of the console, and it adds a bit processor to the Genesis.
 It works the same way a Game Genie works.
 You put it in where your game cartridges go, and then that way, when you put your actual game cartridge on top, its stacked like a tower?
 Yes, exactly.
 This whole thing is so harebrained, I think it added more colors maybe to existing Genesis games, but then it also had its own X games that you bought separately for it.
 This thing was just an unmitigated disaster, one of the worst video game industry decisions of all time.
 The X sells less than million units, total.
 In the meantime, almost immediately thereafter, Sega also rushes out a separate brand new, native bit system to market called the Saturn.
 What a nightmare.
 This makes no sense, whats going on here.
 The story goes that all of this was basically a decision handed down from Sega in Japan.
 They order Tom Kalinske, the CEO of Sega of America, to launch the Saturn.
 Sega of America doesnt really want to do this, but they dont have a choice.
 They spin up their patented brilliant Sega marketing launch playbook for the Saturn.
 They announce to America that September nd, is going to be Saturn Day.
 It is Saturday, September nd, and the Sega Saturn is going to launch on that day.
 But then, at E in May of they shocked the world.
 Tom Kalinske comes out on stage for the Sega keynote and says, actually, I know we told all of you that we were going to launch in September.
 Surprise, were launching today.
 The Sega Saturn is coming out right now.
 The press, the industry, the developers here and there, theyre all like, what?
 Its exciting, but confusing.
 This makes no sense.
 Theres no Sonic game ready.
 Theres no thirdparty games at all.
 The retailers arent prepped.
 They dont know what to expect.
 Theres been no marketing.
 None of the groundwork has been laid.
 In fact, everybody thinks this thing is coming out in September.
 Its really weird because everyones recent hero, the David versus Goliath of Nintendo, seems like they should be firing on all cylinders, but you have the market confusion with a X and the Sega Saturn, and now Sega Saturn sooner?
 What the heck is going on?
 Right.
 On top of this maybe forgivable Sega CD thing that happened a year or two before, this whole thing is just weird.
 On the back of this, the Saturn flops.
 It sells just over million units compared to the Genesis, which sold million units.
 If you read the book Console Wars by Blake Harris, he spends a lot of time with Tom Kalinske, the CEO of Sega of America, and interviews him.
 Tom and the other folks who were at Sega of America this time were somewhat diplomatic, but they just lambasted the Japanese management of Sega at this point in time.
 They say that they had Sega of America fought against all of these decisions, that the Japanese parent company was jealous of Sega of Americas success with the Genesis.
 Because the Genesis sold really well in America, but didnt sell as well in Japan.
 No, all of Genesis' success was in America, Europe, and South America.
 It basically did nothing in Japan.
 In Console Wars, the author draws this great analogy of Japan being the parent and Americas the child, so shouldnt the parent be proud of the childs success?
 But in reality, the way that it actually was going on is that Japan and America were sibling markets.
 The parents' favorite child used to be Japan.
 As the parent showed more favoritism toward America, the Japan leadership retaliated, found ways to kick and scream, and said, hey, you need to pay more attention to me.
 Yup.
 Sega, at this point, of course, is a Japanese company, and the board is Japanese.
 At the end of the day, Japan wins here.
 Tom and most of the rest of the team at Sega of America get super frustrated.
 They end up just leaving the company, including Steve Race, who masterminded the whole aggressive marketing strategy behind the Genesis, the Sega scream, the welcome to the next level.
 He goes to work for Sony to launch the PlayStation.
 Yes, we will talk much more about that in one minute.
 Sega of Japan is running the ship now at this point in time.
 They decide after a couple of years to give up on the Saturn.
 They launched another new internally developed console, the Dreamcast.
 The Dreamcast actually had some real innovations to it.
 It was the first true online console that shipped with internet connectivity builtin.
 It had the little slide out handheld thing that was a little Gameboy that popped out of the controller.
 That was super cool.
 Yeah, the VMU.
 That thing was cool.
 A bunch of the design philosophy made a lot of sense.
 They were using commodity components instead of special silicon for it.
 Yup.
 But unfortunately, it launches against the PlayStation which goes on to become the best selling console of all time and completely trounces it.
 The Dreamcast sells even fewer units than the Saturn.
 Its really sad.
 After just two and a half years on the market, Sega ends up discontinuing the Dreamcast, announcing that theyre getting out of the hardware business entirely.
 Theyre going to go to just being a video game developer and publisher on other platforms, on PlayStation, on the Xbox, et cetera.
 The company really just becomes a shadow of its former self.
 It limps along.
 Finally, after a couple of years from and of Sega just making games for other platforms, the company got sold off to another Japanese public company, a company called Sammy that was a manufacturer of Pachinko machines, which is the Japanese equivalent of pinball machines.
 Its just a sad ending with a whimper for this once legendary Sega scream company.
 Right, youve got the exodus of all the talent.
 Youre still scratching your head a little bit about how it all fell apart so fast.
 I started digging into why, how, and what were the corporate transactions that actually happened around here.
 David, I feel like theres more to this story because I pulled up PitchBook to look.
 There are a lot more transactions around this company than youve mentioned so far.
 Are there?
 There are.
 If only there were a podcast that went and did really deep research on what actually happened here.
 Yeah.
 While were talking about PitchBook, this is a great time to thank them as our sponsor for this episode.
 Im going to keep this segment very short and sweet this time because you will be able to get a sense of all the great info in PitchBook as a source for this episode, as we go through it later on.
 PitchBook is, of course, the platform you can log into and get great access to an insane amount of private and public company data like what companies raised money, when, at what prices, number of employees, and the board composition.
 Basically, every VC and PE firm I know has a PitchBook account, and its essentially a competitive disadvantage at this point if you dont have one.
 If you want to sign up for PitchBook, you can go to pitchbook.
comacquired.
 Just tell them that you heard about them from Ben and David at Acquired.
 Our thanks to PitchBook for powering many of the insights and stats throughout this episode.
 David, it feels like there are some big things missing from the story here.
 Yeah, you like that little story that I just told you, right?
 It almost feels high gloss, apocryphal.
 If you really stare at it, youre like, Im not satisfied.
 That cant be right.
 This is insufficient.
 Everything you say is exactly correct.
 The funny thing is, though, that listeners, for you all listening, I bet most of you, if you knew any version of the story of the death of Sega, what we just told was the version you probably know.
 While its not wrong, its only one version of the story.
 The other version is both way more charitable to Sega, the parent company in Japan, and also I think way more interesting in terms of lessons we can take from it, so lets tell it.
 If you go listen to our twopart Nintendo saga, we talked quite a bit about Sega along the way, and especially in our first Nintendo episode.
 When we talked about Sega, we talked about them as this arcade company.
 Thats actually what Sega was.
 The home console business, the Genesis, the Master System before it, these were side project offshoots from what was otherwise an enormous and very successful arcade business based back in Japan.
 Totally.
 It started as service games back in the s, s, this merger of arcade game makers and arcade distributors.
 You even had the story that you were telling.
 I think we actually cut this from the Nintendo episode for a time.
 But on Periscope, the very innovative Sega game, they standardized the unit of the quarter as what you pay for an arcade video game session.
 Yeah.
 The arcade industry is lost to history now because, basically, it doesnt exist anymore, but it was bigger than the home console industry.
 Nobody was bigger in the arcade industry than Sega.
 They were the OGs.
 They literally standardized the quarter, as you said.
 That game, Periscope, came out in the s.
 This is before video games.
 This is what was called an electromechanical game.
 There were mechanical elements to this cabinet of submarines and ships that moved around.
 They were plastic and cardboard, and then you fired the gun that had torpedoes that traveled on a light bulb path to hit the ships.
 It was pretty cool.
 It became so successful.
 Sega actually gets acquired in .
 Yeah, I was shocked to see this in PitchBook.
 I scrolled all the way down like I normally do when Im looking at private companies who raised money to see who their seed investors were.
 The first transaction for Sega is from .
 Yes.
 The company that acquires them is Gulf and Western, which is a big oil company based in the US.
 Theyre like, what the hell is going on here?
 It turns out at the time, Gulf and Western also owned Paramount Pictures, the movie studio.
 Ive always seen that.
 I dont think you see it anymore, but the little title screen when the movie is starting.
 Yup.
 They acquire Sega and merge it into Paramount.
 The operations stay separate.
 The boards of Sega and Paramount stay separate, but within Gulf and Western, Segas part of the Paramount empire, so much so that they take their two most talented Paramount executives, and they put them on the internal Sega board within Gulf and Western.
 Do you know who those two people are?
 No.
 Michael Eisner and Barry Diller.
 What?
 I had no idea.
 Michael Eisner and Barry Diller are key parts of the Sega history and all of this, all were talking about.
 This is before Atari.
 This is before there is a home console business.
 This is before theres a video game business, period.
 This is how important Sega is in arcades.
 Twenty years before Michael Eisner becomes the CEO of Disney and long before Barry Diller dreams up InterActiveCorp.
 Yup, this is in the s.
 We also talked on the Nintendo series about how Atari got acquired by Warner Brothers.
 This was just crazy.
 Atari, this video game company becomes part of this movie studio, and then it becomes the biggest part of this movie studio.
 Warner Brothers was just copying Paramount and what they did with Sega.
 Isnt that so funny?
 Wild.
 Part of the strategy that Sega adopted during this time, theyre like a truly international company because the arcade business was a truly international business.
 Theyre thriving in the US, theyre thriving in Japan, theyre thriving in Europe, all over the world.
 They start not only building and creating these games, these arcade cabinets, but they start building out their own arcade centers that they operate.
 Theyre like, were going to make money every which way in this industry.
 Theyre called Family Fun centers in Japan and Sega centers in the US.
 The Sega centers in the US changed hands a few times, went on to get rebranded, and Sega always stays involved.
 These become timeout arcades, which is one of the biggest chains of arcades in the US.
 Sega has got hundreds of these arcades that they are just printing cash out of because theyre making money from selling the cabinets to their own arcades, other arcades, and then the arcades themselves are hugely profitable businesses.
 Yeah.
 Theres a lot of arcades that when you look at the side of them have a gigantic Sega logo plastered over it.
 Its clearly a companyfocused not just on home consoles, but making games.
 When you say a companyfocused not just on home consoles, from the parent companys perspective, theyd rather not focus on home consoles at all.
 Now you can start to see another perspective on things here.
 In Sega publishes the game Frogger that Konami had made, but Sega published it.
 They made hundreds of millions of dollars on that thing.
 In right before the home video game console crash led by Atari, they do million in revenue, Sega does, as a division within Paramount.
 Then when the video game crash happens at the end of that year, Paramount, just like Warner Brothers and Atari, want out of the business.
 They want to divest Sega.
 One of the original founders from back in the day, a guy named David Rosen, and a Japanese entrepreneur of a company Sega had acquired named Hayao Nakayama, engineer a management buyout of Sega for the grand total priceI dont know if this is in PitchBookof million.
 This is the steal of the century.
 Yes, actually.
 Theres a transaction in .
 It looks like the investor name is CSK Holdings.
 Yes, thats it.
 CSK Holdings was a public Japanese company that Rosen and Nakayama knew the management of.
 They financed this buyout.
 They were like the PE shop.
 They were the sponsor of this transaction.
 This is how Sega became an actual Japanese company, even though they were started by Americans to serve military bases back in the day.
 Right.
 Okay, wholly bought out by Gulf and Western, then wholly spun out.
 Yes.
 They bought the whole thing for only million.
 This is ridiculous.
 This company, which is legendary in the arcade industry, did million in the year ended six months before this.
 Why did they value it so little?
 This is the thing.
 Because of the home video game crash in America, video games in general just became this toxic asset that nobody wanted to own, especially Paramount and Warner Brothers was divesting Atari.
 The arcade business got hit by the crash, but it actually was fine.
 This was just an amazing deal.
 The management bought the dip because they knew that they werent actually really affected by this.
 Boy, did they ever.
 I think that was in .
 They would go on to take it public, I think, in on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
 Now its a publicly traded company.
 Yup.
 That makes sense because pretty quickly after the buyout, Sega gets back to their old tricks, and theyre crushing it.
 Theyre pumping out smash arcade hits like Out Run that people might have heard of, a very famous racing game, Shinobi, Afterburner, Altered Beast, which was a beathimup brawler that we talked about on the Nintendo episodes.
 That was the original packin game before Sonic with the Genesis.
 Theyre back to making hundreds of millions of dollars in their arcade business, both making the games and operating them in their own arcade centers.
 Nakayama, who was one of the two guys involved in the buyout Nakayama and Rosen had to get hugely wealthy from this, because of how unbelievably little they paid for the equity that, by the time they IPOd it, would have been very valuable.
 Yes.
 I dont know the details, but Im sure they did.
 Nakayama starts pushing the company.
 He gets worried about what Nintendo is doing and what he sees with the NES.
 He says we should also enter the home console business.
 It sounds like a diversification bet.
 Exactly.
 Rosen, CSK, the rest of the board, were not that supportive because theyre like, were doing great in arcades, I dont really care that much.
 Sure, if you care about this, go do this.
 Thats when Nakayama goes and he recruits Tom Kalinske to come in and run North America.
 Thats a surprising success to everyone, the Genesis in North America.
 Theres the scene that we talked about in Nintendo part two, where Tom comes over and presents his fourpoint plan for dethroning Nintendo to the board in Japan, and the Japanese board is like, I dont know, I dont really like this.
 Now it all makes sense.
 Theyre not dumb.
 Theyre just like, why would we risk pouring all this capital into the home console business when were killing it in the arcades?
 On the one hand, its an innovators dilemma.
 On the other hand, I have to imagine the arcade stayed a very good cash flow business for a long time.
 Its not like that was actually going away.
 Lets get into it.
 Nintendo, the NES, the Super NES, and the home console business, turned out was never really a threat to the arcade business.
 The way arcade technology and hardware worked was very different from the console cycle, and the types of games were different.
 In the arcades, it was all iterative, it was constant iteration.
 Every game that came out was its own proprietary hardware cabinet.
 They were based on designs.
 Theyre called boards, theyre arcade boards, but you could tweak it each time.
 When you think about what Segas pushing with all their addons to the home console, of course that would make sense to them.
 Thats the way their RD team worked.
 Theyd have a core base System which was Segas base bit arcade platform that they based the Genesis on.
 All these games I was just talking about, Shinobi, Out Run, et cetera, ran on that.
 But each new game, they tweaked the hardware a little bit.
 It was iterative.
 They didnt actually have to think about whether we need to create a standard platform for developers to target for the next five years because every cabinet has its own selfcontained system.
 Its not really in their DNA to do a onceeveryfiveplusyear.
 This is the standard thing, we promise not to change it, and we will create a bedrock platform for you developers.
 Thats not really a thing.
 Yes.
 That means a couple things for the market that keep the arcade market not just viable, but thriving.
 The arcades are where the most technologically advanced games are during this era because the hardware cycle is so iterative.
 The home systems, even the NES, as amazingly groundbreaking as it was, because the console cycles have to be designed to last so long, thats not where the latest cutting edge stuff is.
 Those games, the Nintendo games that theyre making, the way Sega counter positioned against them with the Genesis, theyre slow, theyre not exciting, but thats what home console games became.
 They became these long adventures, these fantasy lands.
 Its a very different thing than you would do in the arcades.
 Coming out of this era and then into the early and mid s, Segas arcade unit is just killing it.
 They had those hits in the s, everybody got super wealthy, and then they started really pushing the envelope on technology.
 There was a ton of innovation coming out of Sega.
 They developed the first real modern, great D games.
 We all think now of Super Mario as being the first D video game that consumers used and loved.
 Actually, years before, Sega put out the Virtual series in the arcades.
 This was Virtual Racing, Virtua Cop, and most importantly, Virtua Fighter.
 This game, Virtua Fighter, which was a fighting game, used D polygonal technology.
 If you think back to bit Super Nintendo games, theyre flat, theyre D.
 D games, think Mario youre running around in a D world, all of the environments and characters are built using polygonal math.
 We talked about this a lot on the NVIDIA episode.
 Right, triangles.
 Triangles.
 This is new.
 Sega is the one that actually brought really good games to market with this, and it was all in the arcades.
 Virtua Fighter, when it comes out in is so popular.
 Sega sells over Virtua Fighter cabinets worldwide at a price of plus per cabinet.
 Thats half a billion dollars in revenue on Virtua Fighter.
 Its a huge win financially for the company.
 Even more so, though, its so impactful on the video game industry.
 Once Virtua Fighter comes out, everybody realizes, hey, D polygonal games are the future.
 What year was this?
 This was right as Ken Kutaragi and the team over at Sony are working on their standalone PlayStation.
 Theyve broken up with Nintendo, theyre going to come to market with their own console, and this is pivotal.
 I want to read now from the Wikipedia page for the PlayStation console.
 After Sony witnessed the success of Segas Virtua Fighter in in Japanese arcades, the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear and D polygon graphics became the consoles primary focus.
 Sony Computer Entertainment President expressed gratitude for Segas timely release of Virtua Fighter as it proved just at the right time that making games with D imagery was possible, and that this was the direction the PlayStation should focus.
 The impact of this is huge.
 Arcades remained viable through the s because they had the technological edge.
 But now that Sony is going to enter the market, and they dont care about arcades, theyre going to bring their technology and financial firepower all to the home market.
 Their goal now is to make a machine that can rival the arcade technology in the home market.
 They have the balance sheet to subsidize it, so they can take a strategy of coming into the home with very, very good technology at a price point that consumers could afford.
 Yup.
 Here we are now at the end of into .
 Sony has announced that theyre coming out with the PlayStation.
 Theyre all in on entering the video game market.
 They start going around and talking to all of the non Sega arcade manufacturers, Namco, Midway in the US, Konami, and they start convincing them to bring all of their new arcade games directly to the PlayStation.
 When it first comes out in the end of in Japan and then in the US, its an arcade killer.
 Thats what it is built as.
 It becomes so much more than that over time.
 Its Grand Theft Auto, its Final Fantasy, its all that.
 But in the beginning, the vision for the PlayStation was, were going to take the technological firepower of the arcades, and were going to bring that in a way that Nintendo cant and Sega wont into the home market.
 Of course, all the other arcade manufacturers love this strategy.
 Right.
 We can benefit from writing the Sony platform into the living room, but Sega is going to get caught in the wind here.
 Because they have a home console thats making it so that they cant go in line with another home console.
 Namco doesnt have a home console, Konami doesnt have a home console, Midway doesnt have a home console.
 Before the PlayStation launched, the arcade industry was back up to about billion a year globally, and a huge portion of that was controlled by Sega.
 After the PlayStation launches, by the end of the decade, its down to billion.
 It drops by in just a few short years, and its all due to the PlayStation.
 The PlayStation basically killed Segas arcade business and their console business.
 Yup, thats what happened.
 Now, lets go look at this original Console Wars book type narrative about what happened.
 We have a whole different perspective now.
 All these crazy hardware schizophrenic addons, are panicked responses to the coming tsunami of Sony, not just worrying about the home market, but worried about their arcade dominance as well.
 I have to imagine at some point, Sega of Japan lost their desire to make a great competitive home console because that was the thing that was preventing them from being able to be in business with Sony.
 It doesnt mean that theyre going to stop making consoles right away, but it does plant this seed of, we have a little bit of a strategy conflict here, where we either have to be all in and winning in consoles, or we just need to make games.
 But we cant really be on a seesaw trying to do both and have a foot in both worlds.
 Heres what happens.
 In September right before this crazy X thing comes out, Sony and Namco, now Namco was Segas biggest rival in the arcade business, come out with a pretty huge industry changing announcement.
 Theyre going to partner together to release a Virtua Fighter killer arcade game called Tekken.
 Folks might recognize the Tekken series.
 I had no idea, Tekken is so much more than Tekken.
 The game is going to come to the PlayStation when it launches.
 Its not out yet, but great.
 Okay, we all remember Tekken you played on the PlayStation.
 I think it was exclusive et cetera.
 Its also coming out right now, in September in the arcades.
 In fact, its going to be running on Namcos awesome, new System arcade board platform that they have developed together with Sony.
 Guess what, further surprise.
 This System arcade board developed with Sony is the PlayStation.
 This is just the ultimate knife in Segas back.
 Theyre just basically shipping Playstations inside of these arcade cabinets?
 Yeah, it was the PlayStation hardware.
 There were some buffs to it and whatnot, but Namco and now pretty soon, all the other arcade guys are going to be like, oh, great, were moving all of our development platform for the arcade industry to the PlayStation platform.
 The technological bleeding edge is now going to be, yeah, also in the arcades powered by the PlayStation, but in the home powered by the PlayStation.
 Wow, what a Trojan horse.
 Now, Sega is like, oh, shoot, we are screwed.
 We need to scramble the jets and just do anything we can to try and stave off this apocalypse.
 They launched the X.
 Seems really dumb, but they got to do something like, okay, we need to get into the market right now with a bit system to just try and preempt Sony here and the PlayStation launch.
 Then they massively accelerate the Saturn launch.
 Why did they do that?
 The same thing.
 Theyre just trying to do anything they can think of to steal some of Sonys thunder here.
 Yeah, makes sense.
 The Barbarian is already through the gates on the arcade side of the business because Namcos shipping these System arcade cabinets today.
 Its right at the gates coming next year with the PlayStation.
 Its funny how in our Nintendo episode, the conflict was Sega versus Nintendo, but the death of Sega really is against Sony.
 Yes.
 That brings us to the very famous E conference in May of .
 This is maybe the most incredible video game industry event of all time.
 We referenced it earlier in the show, but were heading into the conference.
 Sony is expected to announce the US release date and pricing of the PlayStation at this conference.
 People expect its going to be in the fall to know whats going to happen.
 Sega needs to do something.
 This is when Sega of Japan tells Kalinske and Sega of America, do the surprise launch.
 Get up there, announce Saturn.
 Just do it.
 Even though the ecosystem isnt ready, the hardware is ready, so were shipping it.
 Tom does that.
 He dutifully goes up.
 He announces, oh, forget Saturn day, you can buy the console now.
 Its in limited quantities at select retailers for a price of .
 Hes basically doing this because Japan has said, either you are doing this, or we will find a new CEO for Sega of America who can do this.
 Yes.
 that is the Sega Saturn price point.
 Available today, May th, .
 Kalinske finishes his speech.
 He walks off stage, they usher everybody out of the room, they turn it over, and they get ready for the next keynote of the day, which is going to be Sony.
 Sony keynote starts a couple hours later, Olaf Olafsson, whos the president and head of all of Sony America, not just the PlayStation, all of Sonys businesses, gets on stage, and he starts giving his presentation.
 He says that the PlayStation will be released in the US on September th, .
 Segas like, great, theyre not moving it up, were going to beat them to the punch, were live today, we got a fourmonth head start, lets go.
 Then Olaf invites the new head of Sony Computer Entertainment America, one Steve Race formerly of Sega of America, up to the podium to give a brief presentation.
 He walks slowly up to the podium.
 Hes got a large stack of notes.
 He places them down on the lectern, shuffles them around, waits a beat, hes ready to give his big speech.
 He looks up, he looks at the audience, and he says, .
 Then he picks up his notes, and he walks off stage.
 Most people in the industry, I think, would agree that this is the greatest moment in all of video game industry history.
 Right, industry announcement type things.
 Yes.
 All right.
 Thats Sony PlayStation for by far the most sophisticated system on the market.
 We will link to the video of this in the show notes.
 Its on YouTube.
 People still watch this to this day.
 The reaction is amazing.
 At first, theres silence because people are like, what did he just say?
 What does this mean?
 Whats going on?
 Then the crowd starts cheering, and then you can hear after about seconds or so, when this really sinks in of what this means, people go nuts.
 Theres another wave of cheering.
 Its unbelievable.
 That last wave is all the developers realizing, oh, my God, we are going to print money because theres going to be so many people buying this thing.
 This exact moment in the afternoon of May th, is the death of Sega.
 Lets go back and think about the three key constituencies in the video game home console business flywheel.
 Youve got the consumers.
 Why on earth would any consumer go buy a Sega Saturn today on May th, on its launch day, that has no Sonic game, has only six games total, and it costs when you now know that the PlayStation which is far superior, is going to come out just four months later, theyre going to have perfect ports of all the latest and greatest arcade technology video games, and its going to cost less?
 Youre not going to buy a Saturn.
 Thats the consumers, then the retailers.
 The retailers are so mad at Sega.
 Sega just completely ruined all of their holiday season planning because for retailers, Q is everything.
 Why are these consoles launching in the fall in the US so that it can be ready for the holidays?
 Sega just screwed all this up.
 Now, more importantly, theyve got units on trucks on route to their stores that they know theyre not going to be able to sell now.
 They are so mad at Sega.
 I think it was KB Toys, which then was a big franchise in America.
 They dropped Sega entirely.
 Theyre like, were not carrying your stuff anymore.
 Goodbye, youre gone.
 Youve got the most important piece, the developers.
 All the thirdparty developers who are sitting there at E watching these keynotes, theyre like, wow, were going to make a ton of money on Sony, and Saturn has no chance of building a meaningful install base.
 If I was planning on developing games for the Saturn, I am now canceling those plans.
 This is just the worst thing that could possibly happen to Sega, the Saturn, and the arcade business.
 Listeners, as you can imagine, there is a tough path that they have to now traverse to get to the Sega that were going to talk about and what they look like as a games business today.
 David, I have a couple of stories that I dont think you know about how they made that transition.
 Im curious to know if I will stump you with that or not.
 First, we want to thank our other sponsor for this episode, its our good friends at Vouch, the insurance of tech.
 Vouch, as you know from previous years, is the best way to ensure your startup as youre getting started, but they have really grown into a fantastic way to ensure your company even as you scale much larger so This season, were talking about reallife examples of startups buying insurance.
 Were going to meet Josh, the founder of Inspectify.
 Inspectify is digitizing the entire home inspection process.
 Traditional home inspections are old school, fragmented, phone calls, paper forms.
 Its a mess.
 Josh envisioned a world, where customers could order an inspection on any property anywhere with a click of a button.
 Funny story that the Vouch folks dont know, I am an Inspectify customer myself.
 No way, thats awesome.
 Ive actually used this service when I bought my house.
 Inspectify went through YC in summer .
 They quickly built the worlds largest network of inspectors.
 They, at this point, realized, we need business insurance to meet many of the requirements spelled out in the contracts they were signing.
 They turned to vouch as many YC startups do because vouchers and fellow YC companies.
 Inspectify went to vouch.
us.
 They cruised through the application, they bought a Europe basic coverage, and they did the lightning fast thing when youre trying to get a company off the ground.
 In as many of you know in the real estate industry, things really took off.
 Inspectify achieved product market fit with big institutional real estate buyers like REITs, who need to run a ton of inspections.
 As many of you running startups know, when your vision expands, and youre scaling a company, a lot of the things that you started with arent necessarily the way that you continue.
 Vouch is the complete opposite of this.
 They are awesome as you are scaling.
 Theyre cranking out certificates of insurance for Inspectify in plus states to onboard all these inspectors.
 Theres a great client services team whos anticipating risks and helping them put together a really robust program that will support them as they grow.
 Obviously, if you are looking for insurance today for your startup, you can go to vouch.
usacquired.
 Save on your first policy when you come in through the Acquired channel.
 Also, email Josh at inspectify.
com if you are interested in Inspectify either as a real estate professional, as a potential employee, or frankly, as a customer.
 I can vouch.
 See what I did there, David?
 There you go.
 It was a great, great experience.
 Our thanks to Vouch.
 Thank you, Vouch.
 Okay, David, here are a few things that I was curious if you knew about.
 I planted the seed earlier with the idea that some people personally accumulated a lot of wealth through Sega.
 One of these people was Isao Okawa.
 Yes, the chairman of CSK, right?
 Yes, exactly, and then ultimately became the chairman of Sega.
 In he had loaned Sega million.
 I believe, personally, in the writing was on the wall, he was coming to the end of his life, he actually forgave Segas debts to him ahead of his death, and returned million worth of Sega and CSK stock, which basically was the bridge that Sega needed to transition a massive shift from the Sega that weve been talking about this whole episode to just being the game creator that they are today.
 Yeah, because all of this RD that was required to go into these new consoles, the Saturn, and we just talked about how the Saturn basically got the floor wiped with it by Sony and the PlayStation Sega would then turn around and pour a bunch of effort into the Dreamcast, the same story would happen.
 But even worse, the Dreamcast sold less than the Saturn.
 The PS, of course, goes on to become the best selling console of all time.
 It takes hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in RD to create these consoles.
 Right, theyre just destroying their cash reserves.
 Yeah.
 You would think when the PlayStation comes out, basically creates a giant sucking sound that takes all of the business and players in the arcade industry, and brings them into the home console with the PlayStation, that Sega would also get decimated in the arcade side of their business, which was the golden goose.
 They do, but they get a stay of execution for a couple of years.
 Thanks to this partnership that they do with the Japanese developer Atlus to launch Purikura machines.
 Yes, the core gaming experience of the arcades does get totally gutted and Sega along with it.
 But almost like Nintendo and Pokemon, this Purikua thing are photo booths like selfie booths.
 I did read about this.
 I just didnt know what it was called.
 This becomes the origin of the selfie phenomenon that, of course, started in Asia and then moved to the rest of the world.
 Sega was right there at the beginning of this.
 The photo booths in the late s make over a billion dollars in revenue that Sega plugs into their arcade business division Now this is not the arcades by any stretch of the imagination.
 It makes sense, though.
 Its the same distribution channel.
 Its the same location as arcades.
 Exactly.
 But unlike cutting edge technology in the arcade video game business, there is nothing defensible about this.
 Its a one time cash grab.
 Exactly.
 Once both the fad subsides and competition springs up, by the end of the decade, Sega can no longer continue in the hardware business on any front.
 What did they become?
 They become a games publisher.
 You can get Sonic on Nintendo platforms on the PlayStation and Xbox.
 Thats great.
 They make mobile games.
 I remember in the very first iPhone game that I had was Super Monkey Ball, which was a Sega game.
 Yup, actually a really good game, a super fun puzzle game.
 Yeah, and it was perfect for the iPhone handheld device with accelerometers.
 It was this natural fit on mobile as people were trying to explore that form factor and figure out what it should be.
 In fact, it was, I believe, in one of the original Apple iPhone OS App Store keynotes to show off what games you could make and what types of experiences you could do on this device.
 We keep talking about the Sammy.
 What was the Sammy transaction?
 And what was Sammy before Sega Sammy?
 Sammy was and is a Pachinko machine manufacturer and operator in Japan beyond the scope of this episode, but Pachinko is like pinball used to be in the US.
 Its like gambling meets pinball.
 Its much smaller than a pinball.
 Its a small vertical type thing.
 On the one hand, its gamingesque.
 On the other hand, its also like a slot machine, just like pinball was back in the day in the US.
 Thats what Sammy was.
 They had made some video games in the past.
 They had a small video game division.
 They acquire Sega and merge that into their video game division.
 Its fine.
 Its still a public company.
 You could say maybe at the bottom end of the majors or the top end of this mid level game publishers out there, its fine.
 PitchBooks got this around for the Sega and Sammy merger, and theyve just been Sega Sammy publicly traded ever since.
 More stats from PitchBook today, theyre a .
 billion market cap company.
 If you back out their cash, they have an enterprise value of about .
 billion.
 Last year, they did .
 billion in revenue.
 Clearly, the market doesnt think much of them.
 With a revenue multiple of .
, its a little bit of a zombie company.
 Yeah.
 This is a good spot to transition to analysis here.
 I think theres a couple of interesting things to talk about in the playbook, and then we have a fun way to end the episode.
 One of the things I want to talk about is, despite all of these machinations and mistakes, they do have some pretty great IP in the company.
 The Sonic movie, its no Mario movie, but it did pretty well.
 People still love Sonic the Hedgehog.
 The Yakuza franchise is strong.
 There are lots of other franchises within Sega.
 Is there almost, Im wondering, an LVMH, Bernard Arnault style takeover opportunity here?
 Could you come and acquire either the whole Sega Sammy company or the Sega IP out of it and do it right?
 Theres so much more that could be done with this stuff.
 I dont think so.
 My take on this whole thing is that Sonic was a one trick pony, and that they never really found an effective way to expand the franchise.
 They came out with a bunch more stuff that had Sonic on it, but I never wanted to play D Sonic the way that I wanted to play the original Sonic the Hedgehog side scroller game.
 It feels to me like theres a lot of nostalgia to play with, but it didnt really create any durable extensible IP or gameplay, frankly.
 Right.
 Back to the difference between Sega, Nintendo, the games, and the difference between Miyamoto and Sonic Team.
 Segas DNAthis is the whole point of this episodeit was the arcades.
 The type of game you make for an arcade is very different from the type of game you make for a packaged good home console.
 Sonic was the perfect arcade style game.
 That first level in the first Sonic was so good.
 Even the subsequent D stuff like Sonic Adventure and beyond, the first level of Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast is so good.
 It really is.
 You play it and youre like, wow, this is D Sonic, this is everything I remember.
 The first level is in an island setting, and youre chasing a whale, running around at sonic speed, and doing D looptheloops.
 Its super fun.
 But the problem with these games and with Sonic is, its super fun for five minutes, and then youre like, okay, Im done.
 Whereas Mario and Zelda, its not as fun in the first five minutes, but you can play it for hours and lose yourself in it.
 Since we did most of the analysis commentary in the story, lets just ask the question, what could have saved Sega?
 This is where its probably worth sharing the Jim Clark story.
 This is a great excerpt from Console Wars.
 I had no idea.
 Weve talked a few times about Netscape, Jim Clark, and SGI, and how the internet almost happened on Ns with Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark together.
 You may know that the N was based on SGIs architecture.
 You needed an expensive SGI workstation to create the amazing graphics games.
 A big reason why the best N games were firstparty and there werent a lot of thirdparty games.
 Right, but the way that that came about is crazy.
 It was actually Tom Kalinske, the CEO of Sega America, who wanted to do the partnership with SGI.
 He saw the potential in the cutting edge chips.
 After the potential Sony partnership that we referenced earlier fell apart between Sega and Sony, he came back to Sega of Japan with a pitch saying, I just met with Jim Clark, I really think we should do something with SGI, I think our next generation console should be powered by SGI.
 Sega of Japan got back to Kalinske and said, no.
 When Kalinske pressed them and said, why, its a no brainer, they said, the chip is too big.
 Kalinske was like, what, this doesnt make any sense.
 And they were like, thats our decision.
 He had to have this really hard phone call with Jim Clark saying, Im sorry, man, I actually dont have a deal for you here.
 Japan is against it.
 Jim Clark goes, what am I supposed to do now?
 Kalinske, in this incredible moment of frustration, where he seems half a foot out the door, looks in the phonebook, looks up Howard Lincolns phone number, and says, you should call Nintendo of America, which I cant believe that actually happened.
 I know.
 Its so crazy.
 Again, understanding what we know now from the Sega story, its not just that Sega of Japan was being really dumb and arrogant here.
 Right, that was a reasonable business decision.
 Because at that very same time that Tom was calling up Japan and being like, oh, were going to do this thing with SGI, the Sony apocalypse was coming in the arcade business with the System Namco, and the PlayStation.
 I can totally understand Sega of Japan being like, look, doing this SGI thing, thats not what we have time for right now.
 Yeah, I also think there was probably some kind of not invented here sentiment, where it has to happen in Japan within Segas walls in order to be a viable strategy.
 It is a little weird.
 Its not like they already were thinking, we should just be a software business, because they did have the Dreamcast after this.
 To me, it feels more like a lack of willingness to partner than it does a business model conflict.
 Had that happened a couple years later, you would have been like, okay, clearly you should get out of the console business, so dont invest in new hardware partnerships.
 I think this is just, we dont know those guys, we dont trust those guys, so were not working with them.
 Who knows if it could have saved Sega, but maybe.
 Thats probably the closest thing that I can think of too.
 Had that happened, probably it still wouldnt have saved Sega, but at least the Dreamcast might have had more of a chance of success.
 Maybe.
 Well never know.
 Carve outs?
 Carve outs, lets do quick carve outs.
 I have one funny story before giving my carve out.
 This is a thing that also got cut from both the last episode, and Im not letting it get cut from this episode.
 The Sonic origin story is hilarious.
 In an interview years later, Naoto Ohshima, who was one of the creatorsI think he was the designer of Sonicwas asked, how did you come up with Sonic?
 This blue hedgehog, why does he look like that?
 He just says, I put Felix the Cat on the body of Mickey Mouse.
 I was reading that, and I couldnt believe it.
 You look it up and youre looking at Felix the Cat, youre looking at his eyes, his head shape, and youre like, oh, my God, its Felix on Mickey dyed blue with sneakers.
 Its ridiculous.
 To your point about Sonic being beloved isnt really the super deep IP.
 No.
 Kalinske and team gave it a good run, but man, it was thin all the way around.
 It was.
 All right, what do you got on carve outs?
 I want to recarveout your carve out from a couple episodes of Daryl Morey on Invest Like the Best.
 I listened to it after you recommended it.
 Daryl, now the GM and president of basketball operations at the Sixers, formerly the GM of the Houston Rockets, hes just brilliant and so fun to listen to, whether you care about basketball or sports at all.
 He was a computer science major.
 Hes very, very interesting.
 Patrick is just such a good interviewer.
 He really is a masterclass in how to conduct a truly interesting explorative discovery based interview.
 I learned so much from it.
 I really enjoyed it.
 Yeah, its so good.
 Okay, I have three.
 Theyre going to be fast.
 My God, if you are not watching this season of Succession, its the best television Ive ever seen.
 Just remarkable storytelling.
 Im keeping a close eye, and I suspect many of you are as well.
 In the next month, Starship is scheduled to launch.
 SpaceX launch is always our who knows on the date, and Elon things always slipped, but it is on the launch pad.
 Theyre doing lots of prelaunch inspections and tests.
 It is going to be so freaking cool to watch that thing do its first launch.
 I said this to David.
 David, have you watched it yet, Six Days to Air?
 I havent yet.
 All right.
 If you like this and you like South Park, you will love that.
 If you like this and you like watching creativity and action, but youre not so sure on South Park, you may still love it.
 It is a documentary about the process of conceiving of a South Park episode idea on a Thursday and then having it air the following Wednesday, and the unbelievable sixday turnaround.
 Theres just nothing more special than watching creativity in action.
 I think the documentary is years old at this point, but a pretty special view into their process.
 Nice.
 We can learn some stuff for Acquired.
 A lot we can learn.

 Welcome to todays show where David and I are on the other side of the microphones.
 We are joined by a friend of ours, Nathan Baschez.
 Im a long time listener, first time caller.
 Thats what I am.
 I think thats the first time weve used that I think the Jetsetter episode.
 It was with the Jetsetter CEO what it was on.
 It was with booking.
com with you.
 Thats right.
 Nathan is not only probably one of the most qualified to interview us, but also just a super fun personality.
 Im so excited to have you here in the mix.
 Ill introduce you, then Ill turn over the host reins, and sit back and relax.
 If that sounds good.
 Thats great.
 Nathan most recently has been writing a business strategy newsletter called Divinations.
 When he launched it a few weeks ago, he and I were talking.
 He said, Hey, what do you think about one of the early posts being what is the business behind Acquired and the strategy of why you guys are doing, what youre doing, and how you do it?
 Nathan was kind enough to interview us in that format and publish it a few weeks ago.
 We thought itd be cool to do a deeper dive and a followup as an LP episode.
 Nathan, of course, is a founder before that and a great product person, and now, also a great strategic thinker, writer.
 Nathan, you play a lot in these tech content tie ups or amalgamations.
 How do you describe the businesses that youre drawn to?
 I would definitely say the general theme is people trying to build things that utilized the Internet to make people smarter or to help people make themselves smarter.
 Gimlet Media is one place I worked and Ive learned a lot from what they do.
 It was amazing to get to go in the office every day and work with such creative people, building such cool stuff.
 I started a company called Hardbound that had a new, visual, tappable format for reading on mobile.
 That was a lot of fun.
 We had stories like what is fire or explaining disruptive innovations, which is a precursor to Divinations.
 The format was like Snapchat stories before Snapchat stories.
 It was the first vertical tappable storytelling novel experience.
 Yeah.
 It was right around when Snapchat stories was taking off and its a similar format, but imagine with illustrations and words that are very premeditated as opposed to just quick little captioney type things, where youd really consume an actual piece of writing.
 Almost like a graphic novel in some ways, but yeah, in a Snapchat storyish format.
 Thats cool.
 Thats really cool.
 Listeners, before I turn over to Nathan, if you do want to sign up for Divinations, I know Nathans got a special discount code for listeners of the LP shows.
 Nathan, how do they get access if theyre interested?
 I do.
 You can sign up for free to read the free interviews at divinations.

 But if youre curious about the payload stuff, which is the more indepth explainers of ideas in businesswe explore tradeoffs and run really deep posts and that kind of stuffyou can go to divinations.
substack.
comacquired and there you get off your first year.
 Just for you.
 All right, lets do it.
 Cool, okay.
 The thing that Ive always been curious about is, when youre doing research for one of these episodes, how many times do you change your opinion?
 Do you start off and youre like, Oh, I totally get it, and then you fill it in more and more.
 Or are these radical paradigm shifts where like, This is genius, and then youre like, This is terrible, and its all over the place.
 Ben, you want to go first?
 Yeah.
 It changes probably once or twice.
 Probably whats more interesting is when does it change.
 That is usually when Im getting into the financials.
 The best case scenario is the public company and I actually get to look at the income statement and I have a realization, like the Disney one where Im like, Oh my God, Parkson merge makes twice as much as the movies do.
 Then, I have to rethink every other thing in the episode to look back and go, Okay, that actually should frame the relative importance that I put any given event, because my previous thinking was about the movies and the Parkson, the merch.
 There are secondary revenue stream that served to get people more excited about watching the movies and the sequels.
 It turned out that when you looked at the numbers, that that was not at all the case.
 It was the other way around.
 Usually the closer I can get to the financials, the more likely that is to shape my thesis, so I try and do that as early as I possibly can.
 My opinion changes.
 It depends on the episode, but frequently I would say, usually at least once if not two or three times.
 The first time it usually changes is just in the process of digging in and doing research.
 I cant tell you the number of times Ben and I have decided to do an episode and were like, Okay there might be a story here, were not totally sure.
 This seems like a boring company, and then you get half an hour into the research and youre like, Oh my God!
 Im just scratching the surface.
 There is so much here.
 The other thing that David will do is David texts me a lot.
 Hes like, Hey, actually episode has to change.
 Its not about this acquisition, its about these three acquisitions, or, Its about the story of this company as a whole, or, Actually, the story of the company as a whole isnt interesting.
 Its about this transaction and the year period afterward.
 David, what occurs to you during the research a lot is how we need to frame what the interesting story is.
 Yeah.
 When we decide to do an episode, we think there might be something there.
 Sometimes we know what it is and sometimes the episode turns out as expected, but sometimes, its just a hunch and then during the research we figure out like, Okay, heres the interesting piece.
 We have a policy Ben and I that we will discuss before an episode while were preparing.
 Hey, if theres something, heres some direction.
 Make sure you look in this direction, but we dont discuss specifics.
 We dont discuss like, Oh, this is what I think ahead of time because we wanted to be fresh.
 You have like a firewall where you force yourselves to independently come to perhaps different conclusions.
 Yeah.
 You can say facts to each other, but you shouldnt lead the witness, is how we look at it.
 I dont want to express my opinion to David because I dont want to take color his.
 Yeah.
 We did that in our first couple episodes.
 We realized we talked for hours and not record.
 And then when were recording, wed already said everything.
 This wasnt compelling.
 What I do, usually in the couple hours right before we record an episode, Ill go through all my notes which are usually pages and pages long.
 Wait, are we talking pages?
 pages?
 pages?
 An average main show script Its not a script, not wordforword, but notes, is usually pages.
 Okay, thats pretty solid.
 Yeah.
 I go through all those bullet points that Im taking real time as researching and then I break them out in the sections.
 I would usually call it chapters and Ill put a title for each chapter, like heres the introduction, heres chapter one, chapter two, chapter three or act one, act two, act three.
 The process of doing that doesnt usually change by an opinion, but gives me another layer of take on the company.
 And then actually on the third time in many episodes, when Im changing my opinion is in the process of recording and discussing with Ben.
 Like live.
 Like, As I say this actually, what occurs to me is  Exactly.
 This happened to us during TikTok.
 All of my research and all the arguments I was prepared to make framed around Facebook and Instagram, and the right comp ended up being YouTube, based on the particular type of followerfollowing model and ratios.
 I was like, Oh crap.
 I had to onthefly, at the end, change a lot of the analysis to be more YouTubecentered.
 I think anybodys listening at the episode does take that hard left when I feel like we collectively had the YouTube realization at the end.
 Have you ever had to scrap stuff youve recorded because you realize you changed your opinion so much that you almost want to start over?
 Not for that reason, but we have scrapped stuff we recorded because it wasnt good.
 Howd you know it wasnt good?
 Because its got to be hard to just throw away something once youve Yeah, its super hard.
 If we think it might not be good, we send it to friends and were like, Is this bad?
 If they tell us its bad, then we scrap it.
 In the process of doing the episode, by the time we come to the end, often times we feel like in the beginning.
 If weve changed our opinion on something, like this rabbit hole we went down, not that compelling or not relevant.
 More often than not what happens is theres just bad sections that we just need to wholesale cutout.
 Got you.
 Do you do the editing yourselves?
 Do you have someone who will tell you like, This section is bad?
 Or you have to listen to it and decide for yourself if you think a section is worth cutting?
 Its the latter.
 We started with just me editing.
 Its enormously timeconsuming.
 Its fun, but its enormously time consuming.
 We have an outsourced editor that we work with now, that takes the first pass, then David and I both listen to it, we take notes on anything additional that we think needs to be there.
 Sometimes when we record a sentence or a word or something if we just got a fact wrong, but most of the time, its just cutting.
 And then, Ill take the second pass of going through in Adobe Audition and its like cutting the parts that we need the cut.
 Its you literally rerecorded, youll say something million and you meant to say billion, and you just have to say the word in the same way so that when you spice it in, it doesnt sound weird.
 Thats correct.
 In fact, I had to rerecord the episode number because we switched Convoy in LTSC.
 That was such a pain because it was a live show.
 Yeah.
 It was actually really hard because the music was playing in the background.
 It doesnt sound perfect, Im sure many people listened to it and realized something weird happened there.
 I feel like theres room for some machine learning AI, like audio editing, make it sound like when youre live or whatever.
 Blend it because someone whos laughing a little bit in the background or something.
 Descript does an interesting job of, Im a nerd voice double demo.
 I can type out a sentence and press go and itll all be me speaking the sentence, but the problem is wed have to pour our entire work flow over to do it in the Descript to take full advantage of that.
 And I havent got to that place yet.
 But Im playing around with it.
 Its really cool tech.
 Totally.
 This is a good transition about the time you spent editing, because one of the things we talked about in the interview, about reasons to launch a paid podcast even though this is not the primary goal, this is not to generate revenue, was so that you could use that revenue and reinvest it in this tradeoff, which is how you spend your time.
 You have a limited amount of time obviously to dedicate to this since its not a fulltime thing or even for a full time thing, youd have a limited amount of time.
 I think one of the key uses was to invest in editing help or something else like that.
 Tell me the story of that, what impact it made in all that.
 The underlying business strategy theme here is leverage on time.
 Also, only doing your core competency.
 How do we identify what the core competency of us at Acquire is and how do we outsource everything else, to get the most leverage possible on the time that we do spend to create the greatest product in the smallest amount of time.
 Were not interested in making a worse product in spending only a half hour or something or only the time that we spend recording the episode, but we are interested in figuring out whats the lowhanging fruit where its really a poor use of our time.
 Editing, at least the first pass was one of those things, where removing uhms, or background noise, or making sure the audios leveled correctly.
 That was an easy one to say, Awesome.
 That is a great thing to throw dollars at and the more we can do things like the LP program, the more we can throw dollars at that.
 Another one is travelling to guests.
 This one is actually not that big.
 David, this was one that youve been hardcore about.
 You want to talk about this?
 Its just so different.
 Were recording this episode remote, its still great, but its so different being there facetoface with somebody in the same room versus being on Zoom.
 Zoom is great.
 Remote work is totally the future and its amazing, but at least for the Acquired format, because we try and go so deep, if youre not there in person with your guest, especially when the guest is the founder of the company, its hard for the interview to be as good.
 This is where the travel actually comes in.
 A part of its about being in the same room, but part of it is we make it really clear that we are making an effort.
 We are coming to you, we are dedicating time, we will do everything for our guests.
 But because they deserve it, theyre giving us their time.
 Its just an occasional, were taking this super seriously, as opposed to, Hey, lets pop on this video call at this particular moment in time.
 A lot of times with guests, too, we dont know them.
 This is going smoothly, Nathan, because weve hung out, weve gotten drinks, wed spent a tumultuous weekend in North Carolina.
 Were not going to talk about the roof of New Orleans and Ace Hotel.
 Yeah.
 But most of the time weve had a prep call with them maybe.
 Or maybe its just like theyre EA has coordinated in and we got a nice intro from somebody, but we dont have a deep personal relationship.
 Theres a trustbuilding exercise that has to happen that, for anyone who has ever pitched for investment over video call for the time, you know its a lot harder to build that human relationship over video call.
 We view that as another no brainer way to spend dollars, is plane tickets and making sure to show up for our guests.
 And when we thought about it more, the leverage on that is great.
 Deeper relationship with these guests, who are amazing people and have done amazing things with them on the show, outside of the show, and our day jobs.
 And then, usually they live in really interesting places with other interesting companies, founders, and things going on.
 We get great networking and business meetings.
 We get to meet our fans in the cities we go to.
 Thats perfect.
 The place where we havent thrown dollars which we could and have had many a talented business school student email us and ask about this is research help.
 I like the idea, Im more enamored with it than David is, but Davids quick to point out and I think hes right that its part of our core competency, thats not the thing to outsource, and thats not the thing to take away from something thats currently working, which to date, of the research, prep, script and all that is us.
 But Ben, Id love you to make the case for why you should have these talented MBA students help you.
 It could be awesome.
 I want to have this fight right now.
 The reason I both want that and I think David is right is because hes the one that does more research.
 Im not the one that is feeling neither the pain nor the gratification and reward of laying out the narrative.
 The thing that I do much more of is trying to have a modernday financial understanding in the company, frame options forward, and what the financial impact to those things will be.
 I dont think David or I necessarily knew that these were the roles we would take, but this is what we both gravitated over the course of doing the show.
 For me, Im like, Oh, wouldnt be that big a deal and would save David some time, and would give me an advance copy of the way the storys going to be told?
 Great.
 That sounds great to me.
 For David its like, Are you kidding me?
 Thats what makes the show good.
 I think it makes a lot of sense that this is why I havent pushed on it at all.
 For the record, Im totally into it, especially if were having a discussion live, real time.
 I love this for the financial piece, especially.
 Honestly, thats probably where we should have an analyst.
 Yeah, that would be great.
 I think for me, my perspective, Im not at all against help on research.
 I do think its super important for me at least in my prep.
 I dont think Acquired would work, or at least I wouldnt be able to, however will I show up on episodes to show up that well, if I just rolled in minutes before, read through the script, and was like, okay, what to do?
 Have you seen The Morning Show on Apple TV?
 The teleprompter comes on and they just go.
 Yeah.
 Its like this point center anchor.
 They write their own scripts.
 Totally.
 How long does it take you to do the research?
 In general, somewhere between hours per main episode for me.
 It depends a lot for me at least on how deep my existing knowledge of the company and the space is.
 Even when it is already deep, I still spend a lot of time making sure I codify that.
 Tesla, for instance, coming into that episode, which was the first of I would say the modern Acquired episodes of, This is going to be a really long one.
 Well see if people like it.
 And it turns out they loved it.
 I didnt know much at all about Tesla.
 I didnt know that Elon didnt found it, I didnt know how the business worked, I didnt know about this was before all the real big drama broke, but there had been lots of drama in the company.
 Theyd almost gone bankrupt many times before that.
 Is this pretty funding secured?
 It is pretty funding secured that we did the episode.
 But not that far before.
 It was still a relevant episode.
 This is actually a huge growth thing for Acquired.
 Its not planned, its not a tactic, but when it happens, its awesome.
 Mostly because we couldnt plan for this, but a news event happens and then we become the content of record that people are sharing to come up to speed on that subject area.
 With the funding secured thing, there was so many tweets that were like, You should go check out Acquired on the back story on Tesla.
 And we are like, Oh, my God.
 What a gift.
 Two quick things on that.
 One, to your first question, Nathan, if we changed our opinion on episodes, Tesla was one Ben and I debated for about a year, whether it was an interesting enough story to merit doing on Acquired episode.
 How crazy is that?
 Fast forward to today and you can hardly think of any more interesting story in tech.
 Period.
 And then two, this may sound like but I dont mean in that way to take credit, like we know the zeitgeist or whatever, but I think stories and companies tend to find their way to us.
 Our list of potential episode topics is well over a hundred companies long.
 We dont have a set process for deciding which episodes we cover, but the ones that start to feel interesting to us at the right moments in time.
 Not always, but oftentimes like Ben says, well put out the episode and something really interesting will happen with the company.
 I think this gets also to the difference of Acquired versus other tech media.
 Were not journalists.
 Were practitioners in the ecosystem.
 If somethings starting to feel interesting to us, then theres probably something going on there.
 Have you tried to codify it at all?
 I imagine if you treated it like this is your fulltime startup, theres a huge temptation to be like, Okay, what makes a perfect episode?
 Lets create our framework of all of the different things and lets turn this into a machine.
 Maybe you havent done that, maybe you have.
 Im just curious, how you think about prioritizing.
 Its interesting.
 I want to first give an anecdote and then we should answer your question.
 We were at the Acquired holiday party where we did a mystery and we went fencing.
 We were in the lift on the way from fencing to dinner.
 We were talking a lot about should we have KPIs?
 We know what they would be, at least we know what the things we would measure are.
 Its in any given season, how many new listeners did we add when you measure an episode by number of unique downloads within days of releasing it.
 I track them in a spreadsheet.
 We made the pretty explicit decision not to set goals that we want to hit because that would take some of the fun out of it.
 That would turn it into work and we would then be focused on what in our life do we have to sacrifice to hit this goal, or what in the show do we have to sacrifice to hit this goal.
 Maybe we do a splashier episode that has a shallower story on a topic thats more likely to get clicks.
 Were like, Gosh, is that longterm sacrificing for the show to hit this shortterm KPI that we thought was important?
 We have enough KPIs and the other aspect of our life.
 Why dont Acquire be a thing that we measure the growth so we can feel what the drivers of growth are, but we dont set intentional goals that we want to hit and take some of the fun out of it.
 The other thing I get on that point is we didnt plan this when we started.
 Although I give all the credit in the world to Ben for us starting Acquired.
 Five years ago, we were working together in Madrona.
 Ben came to me and said, Hey, I think podcasts are really interesting.
 What could we do together?
 The nature of the medium in podcasting is so personal.
 You all are listening to this right now.
 We are in your ears.
 Many of you are probably wearing headphones of some type and we are literally in your head, or if not, were in the airwaves around you.
 Thats not something thats like a screen on a webpage that you can optimize.
 Its a super personal thing.
 And I should answer your question.
 That said, there are things to optimize.
 This happened with Whole Foods.
 I get a text from David, Holy Amazon just bought Whole Foods.
 Im like, Yeah, lets cancel our meetings all morning.
 Lets go get on this right now and then lets try and release it tonight.
 You bet we are part of that first new cycle, and you bet were actually second.
 The first is breaking the news, the seconds analysis, and then the third is commentary on the analysis.
 We are part of the second news cycle that second day.
 That was a huge traffic bump.
 But its worth knowing that that spike will get a lot of listens who are outside of the ideal listener profile, so they churn more quickly.
 You need those to get that exposure outside of the bubble youd normally get, but your attention is going to be way worse than it normally would be because theyre interested in this particular analysis, not, let me go on the Acquired journey and listen to a whole bunch of episodes either in the back catalogue or in the feature.
 Theres these tradeoffs that you make, where if we go two whole seasons without doing something current, theres probably something wrong because were missing expansion opportunities, but if were just like riding the news cycle every daywe got close to this with the last season doing Uber IPO, Life IPO, in a row, in a row, in a rowtheres a danger to that, too, because youre not telling the cool, deep stories of P.
A.
 Semi and Authentech and how that small acquisition or the couple of small acquisitions made the iPhone the powerhouse that it is today.
 Im curious.
 Are there any other episodes that did surprisingly well?
 Maybe it was some small, deep cut thing that you want to do just because its fun and youre like, I dont know if this would be the most popular, but I like it, and it did super well.
 Or conversely, one that youre like, Oh, we got to do this, obviously, and then it just Let me pull up in our stats.
 Also podcasting is a little different because with episodes, audience stability is much greater than, at least in terms of downloads I mean a lot because theres auto downloading apps and all that stuff on the web or something.
 Its much more clear when something was a hit or a dud if theres an article.
 Its actually funny, yeah.
 I used to send a disclaimer to David whenever Id send him an update on how episodes were doing because I definitely am an analytics junkie.
 The moral of the story is Ben is a hero in so many ways, but also all the behind the scenes.
 I ride along for the research, though.
 Thank you, David.
 When an episode is performing really well, at least in the first two days, its not because that particular episode was great.
 Its because the listener base has grown since the previous episodes.
 The last episode was great.
 Right.
 Its definitely a lagging indicator.
 And then you see how is it doing day through .
 Thats really after people listen to it, are they recommending it to their friends.
 And then sometimes youll even see a run between day and day where something catches a spike.
 Its like, maybe the second person that got recommended to is very influential on Twitter and decided to make a big hullabaloo about it.
 Its very different than analytics and other mediums because, as you said, the audience is sticky.
 I feel like theres such a huge opportunity for some enterprising podcast host to build much better analytics around this.
 We had this crazy set up where wed get stuff, export it to Amazon S, then I would screw around with it and people would screw around with it in Excel, then Excel would crash because it was too much data.
 It just terrible trying to get a signal out of it.
 I feel like its actually not ultimately that harder problem.
 First of all, its immature and young as an industry, and second of all, its just different than web analytics.
 Yeah and its been relatively protected.
 The most important thing to note here is you cant execute arbitrary JavaScript on somebody listening to a podcast, the way that you can to somebody loading a webpage.
 You just cant fetch a bunch of data.
 Its basically all serverside analytics.
 In some ways, if youre a growth person, youre like, Damn, its in the dark ages.
 But if youre someone whos a privacy zealot, youre like, This is so awesome.
 User behavior is really protected.
 I think this its another side of the coin of just how podcasting as a medium is unique.
 I was thinking about this a minute ago, on your last question, that weve found that weve neve expected is just the value of the back catalogue.
 The Acquired flywheel keeps spinning faster because, now every new listener who comes in who subscribes, there are hundred episodes for them to listen to.
 Three years ago, they were episodes for them to listen to.
 Yeah.
 A thing that surprised me is that Acquired is apparently bingeable.
 I dont know how.
 I can tell you exactly as someone whos been there.
 But yeah, every time I get that feedback or we see it on Twitter, thats definitely a thing thats an unexpected behavior.
 Maybe its because recording them is so draining.
 Weve tried to do two on one day and we just cant.
 You cant hold that much in.
 What two episodes did you do?
 It was in the early days.
 Its basically we cant hold this much in mental RAM at once.
 I dont remember the two episodes, so I cant answer your question.
 What I can tell you is, the day before an episode and the day after an episode, I know significantly less than on the day we record.
 You get all the information as close as you possibly can to vocalizing it and then it goes away and atrophies afterwards.
 I dont think wed be able to three or four hours worth of content on two completely different subjects held in RAM at the same time.
 Makes total sense to me, as someone who writes and podcast.
 Its like trying to convey something in a good, complete, and accurate way, but in a way thats also interesting and compelling and has a good story, framing and all.
 Balancing all those things in your head at once, its like weirdly emotionally exhausting.
 Theres not a lot of stakes.
 Its not like some personal struggle or whatever, its just like you feel youve given birth or something.
 .
 Have you read Thinking, Fast and Slow?
 Yeah.
 I mean, kind of read it.
 Yeah, everyones kind of read it.
 I previously kind of read it.
 I read it.
 Yeah, I listen to the Blinkist.
 I took his course in college, Kahnemans courses.
 From Daniel Kahneman?
 Yeah.
 Holy And then Thinking, Fast and Slow, I think came out the year I graduated or something like that.
 Oh my God, Thats awesome.
 Yeah.
 It was so cool.
 Thats amazing.
 I bet.
 Thats its whole own episode.
 David had crazy professors.
 At GSP, was Eric Schmidt one of your professors?
 Eric Schmidtwas one my professors, Andy Ratcliffe, founded Benchmark.
 I dont even know if this is still the case now, but at least at the period when I was at GSP, all these CEOs and VCs, theyre right there.
 They would not just guest lecture, they would be professors.
 They would teach courses.
 I took courses where my professors who were there for the class twice a week were full time GPs.
 Like Andreessen Horowitz, Excel, Sequoia, Eric Schmidt was a full time professor of mine.
 It was crazy.
 Good God, that sounds amazing.
 It was so great.
 Let me get to what I was, why dont you just leave us all on throwing out Thinking, Fast and Slow and then not explaining why.
 Oh right, yeah.
 System one and system two.
 For anyone who hasnt read the book, the quick primer is, system one thinking is things that you dont have to do any mental work to do.
 If you see three plus four in a page, its all pattern recognition, so your brain immediately goes to seven.
 Lets say, were walking next to each other and David tells me three plus four and I can just say seven without stopping walking.
 But if he says x my brain basically grinds to a halt.
 I have difficulty continuing to walk, my pupils dilate.
 If Im doing the math actively, I probably cant actually respond or even understand anything else that hes saying afterwards, because Im juggling these things in my head.
 Thats system two.
 The way that I would describe doing an Acquired episode is an hourandahalf of not all system two thinking because you would die, but a lot of system two thinking.
 You are emotionally and mentally exhausted afterwards.
 I noticed I have less willpower in the day after really good episodes.
 Its a draining activity.
 That study filter applicate on will power.
 Its your limiting belief, Ben.
 Really?
 Yeah, its true.
 Ben, you have a fixed mindset.
 That also filter replicate though, unfortunately.
 Not surprising.
 Wait, you got to catch me up more on later on that failing to replicate.
 Yeah.
 Baumeister, hes a professor, he wrote a book called Willpower.
 Theres the whole replication crisis that was peaking in psychology around .
 Mindset, the marshmallow experiment, all that kind of stuff just didnt replicate.
 Its kind of nuts.
 Psychologys in a very interesting state as field right now.
 Let me stop reading the book then because it must all be crap.
 Nathan, you may know more than me, but I think most of Kahneman and Tversky work replicates.
 I think they did.
 I think theyre the ones that arrived.
 Yeah.
 Its cool.
 Anyway, to bring it back to your podcast and your process for creating episodes for the podcast which is a draining one when you complete one, its tiresome, what are some of the moments where youve published an episode and you thought, Insane, that was worth it, all of the stuff?
 Are there any peak moments of best, most proud experiences?
 Yes and I can tell you the ones that I didnt think were good, that got very positive response.
 Perfect.
 I was trying to bring it back to that.
 One for me that definitely felt that way was Square.
 I definitely ended and just felt like we just really nailed the analysis.
 And there are other times where I dont feel that way.
 Honestly, after TikTok, even though that episode did phenomenally well and gotten nice feedback, I was like, Oh my God, we needed to hit that YouTube thing earlier.
 I felt like a mess because we didnt get there earlier.
 Should we rerecord it?
 There were parts we cut.
 Oh my God.
 I got back from a redeye flight, I didnt feel like I was all the way there.
 Sometimes they surprise you.
 The Square one, yeah.
 Its better to be lucky and good, but we did that episode, both of use, Ben and I, the narrative around that, they just recently gone public, the stock was in the dumps.
 It was like a share.
 We did that episode and Ben and I both like these are really good company.
 The narrative is wrong around this company.
 There are a lot of luck involved here, but we were so right and that was so gratifying.
 The stocks are now trading in the high s.
 I think it might hit a share within a year.
 Disclaimer, this is not trading advice.
 Consult your financial adviser.
 This is all historical.
 But that is pretty amazing.
 Its interesting too, looking back, the show was much smaller than I think that we had sub listeners when we did that episode.
 Im sure the show quality is much better, too.
 I want to go listen.
 I still have this nostalgic feeling in my head, like that one was so good.
 But based on audience size, how much the content has matured since then it was probably meh, but our take on the company was good.
 How much audience size influence for an episode, influence how you feel about how you did on the episode.
 Thats a good question.
 In terms of the immediate feedback and gratification, a lot.
 Its just so cool to see numbers spike, lots of people engaging on Twitter.
 Little known fact for Acquire LPs will appreciate this.
 We have there AcquiredFM Twitter account.
 Ben is very active personally on Twitter.
 A couple of years ago, I just decided I couldnt make time for multiple Twitters in my life.
 I actually used the AcquiredFM feed, is like my Twitter feed.
 I check multiple times a day.
 Thats always fun to see.
 Once a little time goes by, things fade.
 I think its just the content that sticks out.
 For me, the Electronic Arts episode really sticks out.
 Its a super fun one, great story, origins of Silicon Valley.
 It was not one of our most popular episodes, but Trip was such a great guest and so smart.
 I think back to that one a lot.
 Yeah, and sometimes, things surprise us, too.
 Weve decided that we need room to experiment, which is why a lot of the LP show was just experimenting grounds, which is why were doing a strange episode like this.
 Nathan, you dont know this yet, but our previous episode that well release soon is an analysis of the most recent Star Wars movie with Chetan from Benchmark.
 Were really trying to experiment.
 Were acknowledging we dont know what will actually work.
 Youre talking about the empires flywheel or what?
 No, it has almost no business We accidentally got there at the end.
 Chetan is really like a Star Wars nerd.
 Its awesome.
 Its amazing.
 Yeah.
 I felt among friends.
 Another one that surprised us was we decided to release the Superhuman episode as a main show episode instead of an LP episode.
 I think that one did the best out of the entire season.
 And that was a season that had Lift, I think was right up there with Uber, some big IPOs.
 It was a strange episode.
 We didnt really tell the whole story of Superhuman.
 We didnt do grading, we didnt do our standard format.
 It was still a private company.
 Its a private, relatively small company.
 Its a product that not only is hot and buzzy right now, but I think Rajol, not only is he a really compelling communicator, but hes got these amazing frameworks.
 I think there has been so many people that are just like, Oh my God.
 I need to reference that.
 People have written blog posts referencing the episode.
 That was another indicator for us, too.
 Maybe more frameworks that are really well communicated, with clear examples of when they worked and when they didnt work, might be something interesting, too.
 Do you ever worry when youre planning out an episode, whether its going to be too nerdy?
 Do you worry about the balance between going all the way as deep as you may want to go versus making it interesting to a wider set of people?
 Thats interesting.
 Im curious what listeners think about that.
 Please write us with a feedback or hit us up in the Slack if you have a view on this.
 I think in the early days we were worried about that.
 I remember getting feedback of like, The show has a lot of potential.
 It gets great, I enjoy it, but you guys use a lot of technical terms.
 Can you make sure you take time to describe everything?
 I do think, though, one of the reasons weve succeeded in so far as we have thus far is we embrace the I dont think were going to shy away from that.
 Yeah, I dont think so either.
 We thought about it as thats a bridge we would cross if we ever actually saturated our market.
 Right now, we have about listeners.
 I suspect theres at least listeners we could get to before wed have to worry about should we generalize the show a little bit more to make it more broadly applicable?
 The how I built this of the world, thats a mass market comp for Acquired.
 I think theyd get about a millionish downloads?
 We dont know for sure, but close to a million.
 I think thats a bridge we would cross if we ever felt like we are actually saturating.
 I dont really know how we would know if we were saturating.
 At some point we would see growth plateau and wed be like, Why?
 Then wed hypothetically say, Oh, we think its plateauing again, then maybe we changed the content.
 Its certainly the show we want to do, so well just keep doing the show we want to do and then trust and hope that the audience is big enough.
 Totally.
 Youve mentioned a lot of times that almost a transition point between early Acquired and modern Acquired or new Acquired.
 You even mentioned one episode I forgot which one it was.
 The Tesla episode?
 Yeah, Tesla was this turning point.
 Can you talk about BT Before Tesla and AT After Tesla?
 Eras of Acquired podcast?
 What do you think of that gig?
 I dont segment in that much in my head.
 One thing I know for sure is in the first at least episodes, history and facts basically just meant telling the deal size.
 Then David really grew into his own and was like, Oh, I can really be a storyteller.
 That was a big turning point.
 I think theres been several ep box along the way.
 The Tesla one youre describing is where we realized that we are in the business of telling the stories of great companies and doing the analysis that comes with that to understand why its so interesting, why is this such an interesting story to tell, why is it so interestingly positioned for the future.
 Beforehand, I think we indexed harder on the analytical.
 We were like, Well, people are here because they want to know if it was a good deal or not.
 I think Tesla was the first time we realized that, wow, there wasnt even really a deal.
 People want to absorb stories.
 I think Tesla was the first episode where the name of the episode is just Tesla, not the Tesla IPO, Tesla Acquired by so and so, even though theyre almost acquired by Google back in the day.
 We did it and were like, this is just the story of Tesla.
 Lets just call it that.
 Which is so interesting because that was about months ago.
 That was  years into Acquired, is when we found that out.
 Sometimes, it just takes a really long time to figure out what market youre in or why your product is resonant.
 Especially in the content business.
 Fortunately, since it was a passion project, even though it wasnt exponential growth, we just kept doing it for a while, but its taken a while for us to figure out why people like the show.
 Even though we asked them the whole time.
 Tell me more about that.
 I would guess maybe six episodes in or whatever, youd at least be talking to friends or whatever.
 Youd have some feedback.
 But that was a yearandahalf or whatever maybe before you feel like you made this discovery.
 Its also a common thing I think for people building software or anything, its just really hard to interpret feedback until getting a lens that feels like it clicks, where you understand what youre doing in a way that deeply resonates.
 A lot of people never get there.
 Did you learn any lessons about how to interpret feedback or is it just about doing a lot of cycles of iteration?
 What did you learn from that?
 One thing we got really aggressive on was surveying.
 We created a really robust survey and we gave away our pods.
 We really promoted it on the show.
 It was the that there were questions on whats your least favorite part about the show, whats your favorite part, what was your favorite episode this season, what was your least favorite episode.
 I really try to mine a lot of data out of that.
 We had five or six qualitative fields.
 Also, who you are, where you live, what you do, what industry youre working, what your job title is.
 We learned so much from that.
 A third of listeners are founders or have been founders of some type, and of the or who arent almost everybody, aspires to be one someday.
 I think if we thought about it, wed come to thought, Oh yeah, founders are probably our bet, then were like, Oh, wow no.
 founders and aspiring founders are our core audience.
 I wish I could tell you, theres a really good methodology to analyze these survey results.
 Maybe David has something more sophisticated, but my belief on this has always been, if you really immerse yourself in the data and you really just live in it, and try and transform it a bunch of different times, then insights occur to you.
 I probably spent eight hours over the course of several days putting on music, putting on my headphones, just reading survey responses.
 When something look particularly interesting to me, copying it and do another document, trying to categorize some of them.
 Im like, This is feedback related to storytelling.
 This is feedback related to , and try and decode it a little bit.
 Just by manipulating the responses enough times, and knowing, Oh yeah, I remember seeing that feedback.
 That was tied to this person who also said this.
 We had responses, but this is the same way I feel about our analytics data.
 I have eight tabs in the spreadsheet, they all are all tracking slightly different things, I understand how to draw the correlations that arent showing up on the page.
 Theyre sort of just in your subconscious where youre going through transforming the data.
 I think thats under cherished thing, especially in a world where everybody wants a framework that you can just run anything through and itll be successful every time.
 Just take the time and immerse yourself in the feedback, immerse yourself in the data, and stew in it.
 There are so many things from this incredible journey so far that were hopefully still at the beginning at of doing Acquired.
 One thing that just so sticks with me is from the Kara Swisher episode.
 That was one that surprised us, didnt perform stats as well as we thought it would.
 I havent listened to it in a while, so I dont know the quality of the episode as a whole, but she said at some point on it like, If you do the work, no one can touch you.
 If you do the work.
 If you do.
 Do.
 The work.
 That leads to greatness.
 You got to do the work.
 But if you do it, itll work.
 It reminds me of this thing, Alex Blumberg, the founder of Gimlet Media, said, Theres no real secret to making the stuff we make.
 Its not something you have to be crazy talented or whatever although he is, of course, crazy talented, but hes honestly, just the thing is, you just spend a little bit longer on it than is reasonable.
 Most people would give up and then you just keep going for three more hours, making it better, doing more research, sticking with the servers.
 Whatever the thing is, just for most reasonable people would say, Yeah.
 Thats about right, you just keep going for a little while longer.
 Not an eternity longer, just like a bit longer.
 You just have this relative advantage of its just a little better, people like things, and its the best thing theyve heard lately.
 Its better than the other things.
 Theres no big secret to it.
 Its pretty crazy here because the StartUp season one podcast is iconic.
 I think people will be listening to it in decades.
 He said thats all there was to it.
 Its so spot on.
 Its funny.
 Amira, whos the CEO of Glow, accredits Gimlet with captivating her into podcast initially.
 Obviously, Serial was podcasting this big moment, but I think the StartUp podcast was that for a lot of people, too.
 Before we go, I want to also ask, have there been any low lights?
 What are the moments that were the worst where you thought, Why are we doing this?
 Yes.
 I dont think Ive shared this with David yet.
 Its not just a scoop for the audience, its a scoop for David, too.
 Yeah.
 Let me see what episode it was.
 There was a string of a few episodes early on where we saw this nice initial growth and we were like, We have hundreds of people listening, and then stayed for a while.
 We did a few episodes that I wasnt personally that interested in.
 We were like, Sure, we should do this because we should learn this stuff.
 But I found myself, even while I was doing the episode, opening other things on my computer, zoning out a little bit.
 I was like, Well, if Im doing that, then our audience is definitely doing that.
 Wait, youre on the microphone and you have Twitter open or whatever?
 For sure.
 I remember that.
 Im like, I wonder if this things dead.
 Im trying to remember when it was.
 I think it was in this era of maybe Broadcom, Qualcomm, Blue Bottle Coffee, which you would think Id be more engaged in.
 Atlassian, which I want to do again because theres so much good stuff there.
 Booking.
com, I was pretty excited about.
 Activision Blizzard.
 I definitely was having some, I dont think I had found my role in the show yet, which is a weird thing to say.
 Thats how I recall that period going.
 I dont remember if I listened to them, but those were not great episodes either.
 I used to say this a lot, and I think its still true.
 Its just fun.
 If youre having fun doing it.
 Were both nerds about tech, business in tech, and these companies.
 That just makes it fun, especially the first year plus.
 We maybe had hundreds of listeners, maybe.
 There was nothing going on that indicated that this was worth pursuing, but we just kept doing it because we like doing it.
 Which is so interesting in this context, I think about this a lot with IPSL.
 We aggressively kill new startup ideas that arent instantly showing signs that there could be a therethere from customer interest.
 I think I said this before with Acquired, we wouldve killed it very quickly.
 Now granted, IPSL is not in the business of starting content business, but it doesnt matter.
 Right.
 If youre running a podcast network, you would have been like, This is a dud.
 Nope, this ones not performing.
 Yeah.
 You said there were hundreds of listeners, maybe.
 Was that even a year end?
 It was like, Oh, we got downloads.
 I think so.
 The oldest one that I have tracked here was Zappos against Gravity Nest which is two years ago.
 Im sure I could dig up old SquareSpace data from older stuff.
 Yeah.
 We SquareSpace.
 Not known as a podcast host.
 No.
 No.
 actually, its a massive podcast host, but thats a mistake for all the people doing that.
 Fair.
 When did you decide to take off?
 Youre at downloads per episode now, it sounds like.
 We have or so on Rover and that was season episode .
 The very next episode was Tesla and that had Were like, Oh, my God!
 Basically, every episode would grow by downloads, all season before that.
 We were like, Cool!
 Linear growth, we found a formula to grow.
 Then Tesla was like, Oh, my God!
 We just got bump in one episode.
 Thats so good.
 Im glad the data backs my instinct that Tesla was the turning point.
 I think we did Instagram part two last year.
 That one had around or so.
 These are all downloads in the first days.
 Yeah and then the very next one was Lyft that had Sometimes you get these insane spikes.
 Obviously, because both Tesla and months later Instagram were both theres a bunch of variance and there are ups and downs in the middle.
 But sometimes you just get these ones that bring you all these new listeners and get you totally reenergized about the show.
 And how does it work?
 Is it just people love it because its a great one, so they tweet about it at a higher rate than other episodes so you get more listeners?
 Or is it hitsdriven?
 Or maybe not a lot of tweets happened, but one random person with a ton of followers like Ben Thompson tweets you or whatever?
 How did it work?
 Its some of both.
 Its exactly what I was talking about earlier where theres always the spike and theres always the flight.
 Theres some staying power form the people that stuck around from the spike.
 You just have to know that when we get that Lyft episode and like, Boom!
 suddenly were up at that doesnt mean like, Great!
 Were going to be thats a new floor from here on out.
 Although, that actually was true.
 That was awesome.
 Yeah.
 I dont know if you feel the same, Ben, but whenever we hit those spikes I feel like weve hit that peak on the mountain.
 We got to aim for the next peak now.
 Totally.
 It was like this season that was WeWork and TikTok, where its like, Yeah, why do anything less than that now?
 Youre right, Nathan, we cant really control it.
 We can control what episodes we do but we dont control the new cycle, we dont control who happens to hear it.
 We had someone hear about TikTok and tweet about it, we got a thousand new listeners from a tweet.
 Whose tweet?
 It was Patrick OShaughnessy, right?
 Yeah.
 Patricks show is incredible.
 Its so great.
 David and I listen to Invest Like the Best and think, Okay.
 Cool.
 This is what we can do to up our game when were interviewing people.
 We have our shtick down for storytelling thats different than his show and you listen to things, like what shows to try and sharpen your skills for that or get ideas for that.
 Patrick is one of the best interviewers doing podcast right now.
 When he said, Hey, this is a great show.
 I learned a lot from TikTok.
 I recommend you check it out.
 It was of course crazy gratifying because youre like, I look up to the content that you produce in so many ways and this artful skill that you have, but also because you have to believe the people who listen to his show are super smart and its awesome.
 For however smart we assumed our audience was before, now we have all these reinforcements that we can continue to treat our audience with amazing and profound respect.
 We dont need to lead them all the way to answers.
 We can let them run with whatever they can think of based on the material that we put out there.
 So, thats cool on multiple levels.
 What makes Patrick OShaughnessy so good at interviewing?
 Actually, I was thinking about this a lot when we were getting ready for the Kara interview.
 The number one thing to deliver a great interview is to not be intimidated by your guest.
 When youre having amazing people on, thats the natural thing is to be wildly different, treat them with respect, let them run the show.
 You have to just grab it and say, Mmm, no.
 Im going to run the show.
 That has two pieces, one is just having conviction in your format and being like, Ive done this a bunch so I can do this again.
 The other one is treating yourself with enough respect that you can go toetotoe with that person like, Even though this persons famous or even though this person started a billiondollar company, Im also smart and Im going to have interesting ideas on this show.
 I have to find the right way to steer the direction of the content in the way that I want because I respect myself and my own ideas.
 I think thats hard when youre sitting with some of these people across the table from you.
 So, thats one big piece of it.
 I think another one is letting yourself a proxy for your audience.
 If youre interested, assume that your audience has a bunch of views.
 If youre interested, then you should go there and if youre bored with what theyre saying, you should cut them off and take it to another direction.
 We have attracted the audience that weve asked for and the audience weve asked for is we ourselves on air, so were a very good proxy for what the audience is actually going to think that is interesting.
 Those are my tips on interviewing.
 I think Patrick basically has the same core idea as what Ben said.
 My frame on it is he does a really great job of meeting guests on their level.
 Thats both putting himself on their level but also he interviews broadly in finance and investing of various types, he puts himself and the audience at the same level as the guest, and I think he does that incredibly well.
 Nice.
 What is coming up on the horizon for Acquired?
 Any scoops here?
 Im surprised you didnt ask, but the most asked question of us is when is Acquired Capital part two coming.
 That is coming very soon, were working on some special things for it.
 Were excited to be bringing that this season.
 We want to do more live shows but outside of our show at south by we dont have scheduled yet.
 David and I did some planning and we can look at the content calendar to see what we can talk about.
 We also are going to continue probably on the LP Show but maybe with some between LP Show and main show.
 Our no code theme exploration that started with Vlad and Webflow, that was so fun.
 I think that was one of, if not, our best LP episodes thus far.
 If Airbnb goes public, then we can talk about that, but thats up to them.
 Vlad was so good.
 It was a combination of two things.
 His story and the story of Webflow is amazing.
 He tried to start the company the exact same company, same name, same product four times, and finally, on the fourth time, its become the Webflow we know and love.
 The theme that is behind it, is just so powerful of this nocode movement.
 I think when Acquired is at its best, its the intersection of those two things.
 It is Ben and my aspects of the show.
 Its the story and the analysis, and when those are really compelling together and linked.
 Vlad and Webflow nailed that.
 Can I tell you a bunch of stuff weve thought about but havent done because we dont have time?
 Yeah.
 We keep on thinking about writing a book but we havent.
 The idea isnt that I want to write a book to be a New York Times Bestselling author.
 The idea is to write a book because we get to go on a book tour and we would basically get to do a bunch of live podcasts, probably at companies where tons of people listen to our show anyway.
 We feel like we already have all the content for a book and it would just be about packaging it up in the right way.
 Weve done an outline, we talked to publishers, we talked to book agents, but it just keeps falling by the wayside where its like, Okay, we have day jobs, so already this is a side project.
 In that amount of time, would we rather allocate those hours towards producing the best episodes we can this season or should we go write a book?
 I think we just keep backburnering it in favor of the show, especially when the shows working.
 If the show plateaued, it would be a different story, but if we know that we just keep on growing every episode, were like, Yeah, more of that.
 Totally.
 So, book, thats one.
 Are there any other things that you might do, you might not do, you thought about doing?
 Itll always be inspired by the TikTok episode and some other things.
 Weve been toying with videos and YouTube, well, which are actually two separate things.
 Weve been toying with YouTube and with video.
 There are no plans currently do either one but the intersection between podcast and YouTube I find really fascinating right now.
 I think there is an opportunity for Acquired within that, but we havent figured out exactly what that is yet.
 You could do a video podcast.
 People could watch it in their iPod videos.
 This used to be a thing, Apple basically could have been YouTube with video podcast if you think about it.
 Dude, Im telling you Ive spent hours in my life watching DigNation so I believe in the power of video podcast.
 Amazing.
 I think Leo Laporte coined the term vodcast.
 Right.
 I remember that.
 Its so close to vlog but it just missed.
 This is what Ive been really thinking about is, Yup.
 Been all that, but Joe Rogan, that show is one of the biggest media properties to be developed globally in the past years.
 Three million downloads on every single episode.
 You tell me a media company that has that kind of reach within a day of dropping a piece of content.
 I think the key to it is YouTube.
 I dont think he wouldve gotten that reach and distribution without YouTube.
 Totally.
 I think that three million number Im quoting is out of iTunes, so I dont think that is inclusive of his YouTube downloads.
 Yeah.
 Its estimated he makes million a year in just ad revenue on the show.
 Its wild and its so crazy because its very hard in a weird way.
 Hes amazing at what he does, but its one thing when its like Star Wars or whatever.
 Thats the beauty of it though.
 He makes it seem effortless.
 Exactly.
 Hes a unique person.
 Amazing.
 That is a true statement.
 Cool.
 Well, any other parting thoughts that you two unique people want to leave with your audience.
 One thing I forgot to say is, listeners we actually didnt touch on most of the stuff that Nathan wrote about in the strategy newsletter, so well link that in the show notes.
 It goes through how we think about the LP Show, how it fits into the puzzle of Acquired, how we think about monetization, where we decided to deploy those dollars, what our goals are with the show.
 Theres a lot of good stuff there that didnt need to be repeated on the show, so Im glad we didnt.
 But if youre interested in that, you should definitely check out on Divinations.
 Really well done.
 You guys are very good at what you do.
 Thank you.
 Let me talk about the format for that because I thought that was interesting.
 We spent an hour and a half on a call like this, you recorded it, and then you went back through later and turned a bunch of incoherent rambling into a really tight, welledited piece.
 So, Im curious.
 Just give us seconds.
 What is that creative process look like for you?
 First of all, it wasnt that incoherent.
 Its interesting because the way that people talk is really different than what feels good to read.
 If you look at any transcript, it just feels really dumb.
 Even though if youre to listen to it, it feels really smart.
 Essentially, its like converting it.
 Its like dictation, almost.
 Youre dictating the post to me is the way that I think about it, but I can bring it out of you by asking a bunch of questions as opposed to you having to come up with it on your own.
 The reason you do it is just because honestly, my really good friend Dan Shipper started doing Substack that has a similar style and he found out that style worked really well for him.
 He was like, You should try it.
 So I was like, Okay, Ill try it.
 I think it works pretty well.
 Its pretty cool because I think writing is just really hard, its very painful.
 Theres a lot of people that have amazing insights and stories that I think would travel further if they were in written form on the Internet, especially when you pair that with email distribution.
 Theres some work there, theres some friction to the conversion, but if I take that on my newsletter can be that much better because its this thing thats not just my ideas, its all the smart people like you can share your stories and experiences.
 I just want to get out of the way.
 I almost was like, Well, I just cant possibly do this on a regular basis if I have to be the source of all of the stuff.
 Im sure you all feel the same way.
 The supply chain for you is there are fascinating companies out the world that you can do research on, so its like staring on the shoulders of giants.
 You can read all the interesting analysis that has been written, synthesize it, and paint a picture of it in a conversation in a way that is super compelling.
 You can apply this unique transformation to it, but its not like its coming from nowhere.
 I guess, same principle for the newsletter.
 I think you hit on something really interesting there that I have thought for a while, but the truth is thats probably what makes podcast so compelling is the Venn diagram overlap between people with compelling stories and thoughts to share and people who enjoy writing and are good writers is quite small.
 If you can get more people from the circle of having compelling thoughts and stories to share into getting that content out there, the spoken word is such an easier hurdle to clear.
 Podcasting for me is like writing without all the selfloathing involved in the writing process.
 Oh my God, yeah.
 Seriously.
 I recently tweeted the amount of times I checked Twitter by activity, a little pictograph.
 I didnt even put podcasting as the potential option because I dont check it at all while Im having a podcast conversation, but programming is not very much, designing maybe a little bit more, writing is off the scale in checking Twitter all the time because its so agonizing.
 Im getting a little better at it but Ive been tweeting about writing a lot because I started to do it more lately, obviously, and its hard.
 Its so hard.
 You got to find other writers to commiserate with, which actually Im sure thats probably why youre doing this thing with Dan.
 With Dan, yeah.
 Thats cool.
 Yeah.
 Awesome.
 Well, thank you so much, Nathan.
 Thank you.
 This has been so much fun.
 Maybe well do it again in a year, or two years, or whatever.
 We can make a New Years tradition of it or whatever.
 Im going to hold you to it.
 Thats why I suckered you into it now.
 I get to become a recurring guest.
 Whats your Twitter handle for people who want to talk and write over, who want to find you?
 Twitter handle is nbashaw, which is actually my old last name.
 I merged last names with my wife, so now its Baschez.
 She was Sanchez, I was Bashaw, now were Baschez.
 Anyway, I havent changed the actual handle yet because that feels complicated and hard, but if you search for Nathan Baschez, that also works too.
 Its nbashaw.
 Yeah, exactly.
 Youre some guy named Shaw who plays basketball.
 I get a lot of NBA spam tweets sometimes because people are like, Anybody with NBA in the first three letters of their handle probably is a basketball fan.
 Sometime well go titfortat.
 I get a lot of tweets Gilbert Arenas, Gilbert Arizona, and theres some Italian Gilbert that I dont know, but its fun.
 Awesome.
 Gilbert Arenas, havent thought of that handle.
 We get less of that than we used to.
 Cool.
 Well, thank you so much for having me.
 This has been a ton of fun.
 Ton of fun.
 Thanks, Nathan.
